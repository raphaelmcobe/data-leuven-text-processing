I Want My Baby Back,"I'm working day and night to find me my passage to write
I'm gonna get the next train, going to be right by her side
Ooh-ah Kitty, just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no

I want my baby back, oh no
I want my baby back

I tried to phone her, but the cable was broke by a storm
Now I won't see her till tomorrow, when night meets the dawn
Ooh-ah Kitty, just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no

I want my baby back, oh no
I want my baby back

I'll buy her anything
A big fat car, a diamond ring
If she will be my girl
I want her back, I need you girl

I'm working day and night to find me my passage to write
I'm gonna get the next train, going to be right by her side
Ooh-ah Kitty, just you see
Don't put the blame on me, oh no

I want my baby back, oh no
I want my baby back, oh no"
Bars of the County Jail,"La la la la la la la la (etc.)

Gather you all and listen here
I'll tell you a tale if you lend me an ear
I rode a horse through many a town
But the devil rode me down to the ground
I was to marry a very rich girl
I loved her as only I can
But the father was shot and his gold was stoled
And now I'm the devil's man, na na na
And now I sing a tale of woe
Through the bars of the county jail, na la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la la (etc.)

I walked into the room one night
I found her mother and gun
Well, the man was dead and I kneeled and cried
The sheriff ran in and said ""I'm holding you, son""

La la la la la la la la (etc.)

Through the day I sing and play
For time is on my side
But when the moon and stars come out
I lay me down and cry
For the Saviour, mar I lied
Now I will not have a ride
Beside the window the scaffold was made
On the morrow I will hang...

La la la la la la la la (etc.)"
Baby Loves That Way ( Davy Jones  and The Lower Third) ,"(Baby loves that way)
Yes, she does, yes, she does
(Baby loves that way)
Oh, I love my baby
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh, I gotta take her
(Baby loves that way)
Yep, I love her

Baby likes to go outside, so I let her
Wants to fool with other guys, so I let her
Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad
But fooling around, it will make me sad
She fools around with other boys and treat me like an unwanted toy

(Baby loves that way)
Oh, I love my baby
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh, she does too much to me
(Baby loves that way)
And I can't think too much of her
(Baby loves that way)
Gotta take her, gotta take her

Gonna better leave her alone, put you down son
Treating her real fine, thus I'm home being a loner

Baby likes to go outside, so I let her
Wants to fool with other guys, so I let her
Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad
But fooling around, it will make me sad
She clings around with all the boys, who treat her like unwanted toys

(Baby loves that way)
Obviously this is the end
(Baby loves that way)
Gotta take her
(Baby loves that way)
Ooh yeah
(Baby loves that way)
Can't do enough
(Baby loves that way"
The London Boys,"Bow Bells strike another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing cause the meter's dead
You moved away
Told your folks you're gonna stay away

Bright lights, Soho, Wardour street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you

Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose faith
To let yourself down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with the London boys

You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got
So long as you're with the London boys

A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, 'cause you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own
With the London boys

Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys"
I Dig Everything,"I've got the village I love
I walk along beside the garbagemen and I dig everything
I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back
They don't dig anything
Ain't had a job for a year or more and I don't know a thing
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig

I feed the lions in Trafalgar Square and I dig everything
I've sit just behind my window, till my cigarettes were low and dug
Everything
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town and I dig everything
I'd see people in the street below, who don't know where they're going
They don't dig anything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Everything's spent and I dig everything
Dig

I've got more friends than I've had hot dinners
Some of them were losers, but the rest of them are winners
Rick, John, Sally, a connection named Paul
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall
We smoke and talk in my room and we dig everything
Dig

I've made myself at home
I've made good friends which the time-check girl on the end of the phone
All the movie shows
I sunbathe for love
Even when it's not too hot
'Cause I dig everything
Oh yeah"
I'm Not Losing Sleep,"Yes, I've read the morning papers
Telling me that you've made money
Do you think I'm gonna crawl, then think again

Though I'm dressed in rags, I'm richer
Though I eat from tins, I'm healthier
Though I live in slums, I'm purer than you, my friend

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

Look around and see the friends
The ones you left, our friends deserted
See the guys that used to talk and drink with you

Don't look down your nose at me
'Cause I won't ask your sympathy
I won't be your yes-sir man for anything

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

I would walk with you
Talk with you, drink with you
If you drop that halo that you're wearing on the ground

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

I can't get my satisfaction
Knowing you won't get reaction
What makes me the big attraction anyway

It's too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

Too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend

Oh, it's too bad, I'm not losing sleep
(Too bad) I'm just counting sheep
(Too bad) I'm not losing sleep, my friend"
Rubber Band,"Rubber Band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand

Rubber Band
In 1910, I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes

Dear Rubber Band, you're playing my tune out of tune, oh

Rubber Band
Won't you play your haunting theme again to me?
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon

Oh, play that theme

Rubber Band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber Band
We could play in library parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, I'd find my love

Rubber Band
In the '14-'18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now she's married to the leader of the band, oh

spoken:
Oh sob, I hope you break your baton"
Cant Help Thinking About Me(David Bowie with The Lower Third) ,"Question time
That says I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
It seems that I've blackened the family name

Mother says
That she can't stand the neighbours' talking
I've gotta pack my bags
Leave this home, start walking, yeah

I'm guilty
I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime

I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

Remember when
We used to go to church on Sundays
I lay awake at night
Terrified of school on Mondays

Oh, but it's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again

I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

As I pass a recreation ground
I remember my friends always be found
And I can't

I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

Now I leave them all
In the Never-Never Land
The station seems so cold
The ticket's in my hand

My girl calls my name,
""Hi Dave.
Drop in, see you around, come back
If you're this way again.""

Oh, I'm on my own
I've got a long, long way to go
I hope I make it on my own

I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me"
Do Anything You Say,"Two by two, they go walking by
Hand in hand, they watch me cry
(Two by two, hand in hand)

Lonely nights, I dream you're there
Morning sun and you're gone
(Lonely nights, morning sun)

(Maybe) I'll do anything you say
(Maybe) I'll do anything you say
(Maybe) I'll do anything you say
Do anything you say, do anything

One desire I ask of you
Please be mine, please be mine
(One desire, please be mine)

Thousand years and I'll return
You'll be mine, you'll be mine
(Thousand years, you'll be mine)

(Maybe) I'll do anything you say

Hand in hand, they watch me cry

And I Say to Myself(David Bowie with The Lower Third) ,"And I say to myself
I've got it wrong, wrong, wrong
She is a play-girl
She the wrong wrong girl for me
And I say to myself
You're a fool, fool, fool
She doesn't love you
She doesn't need you, this I know

She's got a trail of men that she takes
Wherever she goes
She hasn't the strength to love any single man for a length of time

(And I say to myself)
Ooh, I don't stand a chance
(And I say to myself)
It's a long long romance
(And I say to myself)
Well, she's out to slay
(And I say to myself)
Well, she's got it made
(And I say to myself)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
(And I say to myself)
Oh yeah

And I say to myself that she shouldn't love anybody else in the world but me
And I say to myself
Forget her now, now, now
She don't want you
She don't love you anymore
And I say to myself you're a fool, fool, fool
She's don't love you
She don't need you, this I know

And I turn around and look at myself
You'll never get her, you're a fool
Say after me I'm a fool- I'm a fool

(And I say to myself)
I can't get what I want
(And I say to myself)
And it makes me sad
(And I say to myself)
I can't get what I want

And it makes me mad

Oh yeah

And I say to myself that she shouldn't love anybody else in the world but me,
Yeah
Yeah

Come and Buy My Toys,"Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red 

Rich men's children running past 
Their fathers dressed in hose 
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes 
Gazing eyes and running wild 
Past the stocks and over stiles 
Kiss the window merry child 
But come and buy my toys 

You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn 
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn 
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threashed it with a quill 
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will 
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys 
Leave the parsley on the stalls 
Come and buy my toys 

You shall own a cambric shirt 
You shall work your father's land 
But now you shall play in the market square 
Till you'll be a man 

Smiling girls and rosy boys 
Come and buy my little toys 
Monkeys made of gingerbread 
And sugar horses painted red"
Maid of Bond Street,"This girl is made of lipstick 
Powder and paint 
Sees the pictures of herself 
Every magazine on every shelf 

This girl is maid of Bond Street 
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives 
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs 

This girl is a lonely girl 
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus 
Buys the Daily News 
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her 

This girl is made of loneliness 
A broken heart 
For the boy that she once knew 
Doesn't want to know her any more 

And this girl is a lonely girl 
Every thing she wants is hers 
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with 
All the time, to love, all the time 

This boy is made of envy 
Jealousy 
He doesn't have a limousine 
Really wants to be a star himself 

This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films 
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor 

And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars 
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars 
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares 
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs"
Please Mr. Gravedigger,"There's a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz
Till the war came along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot

And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand
He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home

""Ah-choo, excuse me""

Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair
And you put it in your pocket

""God, it's pouring down""

Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket

Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only 10, full of life and oh so gay
And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, Oh God

No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
I've started digging holes my friend
And this one here's for you

""Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
Hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
Bloody obscene, catch pneumonia or something in this rain"""
Sell Me a Coat,"La la la la la la
La la la la la la la

A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face 
My summer girl takes little backward steps away 
Jack Frost took her hand and left me
Jack Frost ain't so cool 

Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 

And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away 
Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday 
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand 

Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 

See my eyes, my window pane 
See my tears like gentle rain 
That's the memory of a summer day 

Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 

Sell me a coat with buttons of silver 
Sell me a coat that's red or gold 
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets 
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold 

La la la la la la (repeat)"
Did You Ever Have a Dream,"Did you ever have a dream or two
Where the hero is a guy named you
And the things he does are just too much
Does he fly like Mr. Superman, speak Chinese, French and Dutch?
And did you ever have a dream or two?

Have you ever woken up one day
With the feeling that you'd been away?
If the girl that you dreamed of last night
Had the same dream, in the very same scene
With the very same boy, hold tight

It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can travel anywhere with anyone you care
It's a very special knowledge that you've got, my friend
You can walk around in New York while you sleep in Penge

I will travel round the world one night
On the magic wings of astral flight
If you've got the secret, tell me do
Have you ever had a dream or two?
Have you ever had a dream or two?"
Little Bombardier,"War made him a soldier 
Little Frankie Mear 
Peace left him a loser 
The little bombardier 

Lines of worry appeared with age 
Unskilled hands that knew no trade 
Spent his time in the picture house 
The little bombardier 

Frankie drank his money 
The little that he made 
Told his woes to no man 
Friendless, lonely days 

Then one day, in the ABC 
Four bright eyes gazed longingly 
At the ice-cream in the hand of 
The little bombardier 

Sunshine entered our Frankie's days 
Gone his worries, his hopeless maze 
His life was fun and his heart was full of joy 

Two young children had changed his aims 
He gave them toffees and played their games 
He brought them presents with every coin he made 

Then two gentlemen called on him 
Asked him for his name 
Why was he friends with the children 
Were they just a game? 

Leave them alone or we'll get sore 
We've had blokes like you in the station before 
The hand of authority said ""no more"" to 
The little bombardier 

Packed his bags, his heart in pain 
Wiped a tear and caught a train 
Not to be seen in the town again 
The little bombardier"
Let Me Sleep Beside You,"Baby, baby, brush the dust of youth from off your shoulder,
Because the years of threading daisies lie behind you now.
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told.
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and paints and beads.
I will show you games where the winner never wins.

Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.

Lock away your childhood and throw away the key,
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals.
We shall drink the oldest wine, and velvet skies will linger.
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free.
I will hold a lighted lamp, and we shall walk together.

Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.

Your darkened eyes throw mystery,
But your lips are void of history.
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you?

I will give you dreams,
And I'll tell you things you'd like to hear.

Let your hair hang down.
Wear the dress your mother wore.
Let me sleep beside you.

Let me sleep beside you."
The Laughing Gnome ,"I was walking down the high street,
When I heard footsteps behind me.
And there was a little old man (Hello!)
In scarlet and gray, chuckling away

Well he trotted back to my house
And he sat beside the telly (Ah!)
With his tiny hands on his tummy
Chuckling away, laughing all day

""I ought to report you to the Gnome Office.""
""Gnome Office? Ahahahah!""

Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me,
Said the laughing gnome

Well I gave him roasted toadstools,
And a glass of dandelion wine. (*burp* Pardon...)
Then I put him on a train to Eastbourne.
Carried his bag, and gave him a fag.

""Have you got a light, boy?""
""Here, where do you come from?""
""Gnome-man's land, heehee!""
""Oh, really?""

In the morning, when I woke up,
He was sitting on the edge of my bed,
With his brother, whose name was Fred.
He'd brought him along to sing me a song.

""All right, let's hear it... 'ere, what's that clicking noise?""
""That's Fred, he's a metro-gnome, haha!""

Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me

""Oh now, I'm a gnome, anyway, haha!""
""Haven't you got a home to go to?""
""No, we are gnome-ads, hehe!""
""Didn't they teach you to get your hair cut at school? You look like a rolling gnome.""
""Nah, not at the London school of Eco-gnome-ics.""

Now they're staying up me chimney,
And we're living on caviar and honey (Hurray!)
'Cause they're earning me lots of money
Writing comedy prose for radio shows

""It's the, errrr... it's the gnome-service, yes, of course!""

Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
(Oh, dear me...)
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me

Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me"
Karma Man,"Fingertips sun at sideshow stalls, they throw the balls
At coconut furs that hide behind coloured shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice cream cone, they circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in a tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor 
He's cloaked and clothed in saffran robes, his beads are all he owns

Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

Fairy tale skin depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war, a gentle face you've seen before
Karma man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been, I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin

Slow down, slow down
Someone must have said let's slow him down
Slow down, slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man"
Join the Gang,"Let me introduce you to the gang
Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist
Once he had a name, now he plays our game
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang

Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong
'Cause she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang

Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang

You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
It's a big illusion but at least you're in
At least you're in

This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff
15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke
This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang

This is what to do now that you're here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang"
Love You till Tuesday,"Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you walk out through your door, I'll wave my flag and shout

Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday

Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch
Don't be afraid, it's only me, hoping for a little romance
If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool

Oh, beautiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday

Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me
I shall always want you until my love runs dry

Oh, beautiful baby
My heart's aflame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday
Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday

Well, I might be able to stretch it till Wednesday"

Take a quick, butchers, rotten Harry down the hall
Wouldn't give me tuppence for him"
There Is a Happy Land,"There is a happy land where only children live 
They don't have the time to learn the ways 
Of you sir, Mr. Grownup 

There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves 
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 

Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite 
Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike 
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him 
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us 

Mother calls, but we don't hear 
There's lots more things to do 
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet 
But we will be, very shortly 

Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry 
Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky 
Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away 
Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray 

There is a happy land where only children live 
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup 
Go away, sir 

Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup"
When I Live My Dream,"When I live my dream, I'll take you with me 
Riding on a golden horse 
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you 
Happy at the sound of your voice 

Maybe I'll slay a dragon for you 
Or banish wicked giants from the land 
But you will find that nothing in my dream can hurt you 
We will only love each other as forever 
When I live my dream 

When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me 
And the empty man you left behind 
It's a broken heart that dreams
It's a broken heart you left me 
Only love can live in my dream 

I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish 
Wish, and the storm will fade away 
Wish again, and you will stand before me
While the sky will paint an overture 
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream 

When I live my dream, please be there to meet me 
Let me be the one to understand 
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave me 
Then we can live in our new land 

Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm gonna make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream..."
Uncle Arthur,"Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop 
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up 
Climbs across his bike and he's away 
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street 
Back to mother, it's another empty day 

Uncle Arthur likes his mommy 
Uncle Arthur still reads comics 
Uncle Arthur follows Batman 

Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum 
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum 
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed 
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion 
Sally was the real thing, not just lust 

Uncle Arthur vanished quickly 
Uncle Arthur and his new bride 
Uncle Arthur follows Sally 

Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days 
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze 
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled 
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop 
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed 

Uncle Arthur past the gasworks 
Uncle Arthur past the river 
Uncle Arthur down the high street 
Uncle Arthur follows mother"
We Are Hungry Men,"Here is the news:
According to the latest world population survey,
Figures have reached danger point, my god!
London: 15 million 75 thousand.
New York: 80 million.
Paris: 15 million and 30.
China: 1000 million.
Billington-Spa: lots!

My studies include exophagy.
I formed my own society,
To crush the power of fecundity.
The world will overpopulate,
Unless you claim infertility.
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah?

We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.

I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel 
That they are not infertible.
The crops of few, the cattle gun.
There's only one way to linger on.
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah?

We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.

Achtung, achtung! These are your orders:
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their allotted amount of air 
Will be slaughtered and cremated.
Only one cubic foot of air is allowed...
I've prepared a document legalising mass abortion.
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide.

We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.

You don't seem to hear me clear.
Do I talk above your sphere? 
Let me explain my project, dear,
Show you how I'll save the world,
Or let it die within the year.
Why do you look that way at me, your Messiah?

We are not your friends.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to live our lives.

We are hungry men.
We don't give a damn for what you're saying.
We're here to eat you."
When I'm Five,"When I'm five
I will wash my face me hands all by myself
When I'm five
I will chew and spit tobacco like my grandfather Jones
'Cause I'm only four and five is far away

When I'm five
I will read the magazines in mummy's drawer
When I'm five
I will walk behind the soldiers in the May Day parade
'Cause I'm only four and grown-ups walk too fast

Yesterday was horrid day, 'cause Raymond kicked my shin
And mummy says if I am good, she'll let me go to school in August
Daddy shouted loud at mummy and I dropped my toast at breakfast
And I laughed when Bonzo licked my face, because it tickled
I wonder why my daddy cries and how I wish that I was nearly five

When I'm five
I will catch a butterfly and eat it and I won't be sick
When I'm five
I will jump in puddles, laugh in church and marry my mum
And I'll let my daddy do the washing-up

If I close one eye, the people on that side can't see me
I get headaches in the morning and I rode on Freddie's tricycle
And everywhere was funny, when I ran down to the sweetshop
Then I fell and bleeded-up my knee and everybody soppied me

I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five
I saw a photograph of Jesus and I asked him if he'd make me five
When I'm five
When I'm five
When I'm oah"
In the Heat of the Morning,"The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I'll watch them sink before your gaze
Senjorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love like a ragged soldier
Catching butterflies

No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?

In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning

I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend, I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done
Oh I'm so much in love like the little boy
Who races with the wind

No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too?

In the heat of the morning
In the shadows I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning"

Ching-a-Ling,"Whilst flying through an azure cloud
A crystal girl I'd spy
She kissed the blue bird's honey tongue
And stuttered as she sighed
I wish to sing the chicken song
Ching-a-ling song is fine
I'd give my jewels and caviar
To make this daydream mine

Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,

Doo dah doo doo dah dah, doo dah dah dah dah dah dah dah

While stepping through a heaven's eye
Two lover souls we spied
They wished the cloud boys sang to me
A cheerful happy cry
We love to play our love-strong hearts
No better do we know
No gifts of money do we give
For love is all we own

Conversation Piece,"I took this walk to ease my mind
To find out what's gnawing at me
Wouldn't think to look at me
That I've spent a lot of time in education
It all seems so long ago
I'm a thinker, not a talker
I've no one to talk to anyway

I can't see the road
For the rain in my eyes

I live above the grocers' store
Owned by an Austrian
He often calls me down to eat
And he jokes about his broken English
Tries to be a friend to me
But for all my years of reading conversation
I stand without a word to say

I can't see the bridge
For the rain in my eyes

And the world is full of life
Full of folk who don't know me
And they walk in twos or threes or more
While the lamp that shines above the grocers' store
Investigates my face so rudely
And my essays lying scattered on the floor
Fulfill their needs just by being there

And my hands shake, my head hurts
My voice sticks inside my throat
I'm invisible and dumb
And no one will recall me

And I can't see the water
For the tears in my eyes"
Cygnet Committee,"I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you that sets the test

So much has gone and little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter

""I gave Them life, I gave Them all
They drained my very soul dry
I crushed my heart to ease Their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can They spare

What of me?
Who praised Their efforts to be free?
Words of strength and care and sympathy
I opened doors that would have blocked Their way
I braved Their cause to guide
For little pay

I ravaged at my finance just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me""

I bless you madly
Sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes
Because it's you that sets the test

So much has gone and little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream
Where all is God and God is just a word

""We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers he had
Not of the best of men, but Ours

We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill Our needs
Now We are strong

And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
The silent guns of love will blast the sky

We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage
Where money stood, we planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers, sons of dirt

Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yeah, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor on slogans such as

'Wish You Could Hear'
'Love Is All We Need'
'Kick Out The Jams'
'Kick Out Your Mother'
'Cut Up Your Friend'
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'

And We know the Flag of Love is from above
And We can force you to be free
And We can force you to believe""

And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
""I believe in the Power of Good.
I Believe in the State of Love.
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right.
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right.""

And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain on the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Plowing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich

And I Want to believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to believe
There's a light shining through somehow

And I want to believe
And you want to believe
And we want to believe

And we want to live
Oh, we want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
We want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live
I want to live

Memory of a Free Festival,"The children of the summer's end gathered in the dampened grass
We played our songs and felt the London sky resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven
Touch, we touched the very soul of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something just the same
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head and away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd and we walked back to the road, unchained

The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party"
Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed,"Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to, you won't be the first or last

It must strain you to look down so far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you

I'm the cream
Of the Great Utopia Dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths of your banker's spleen

I'm a phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain
I keep having this brainstorm 
About twelve times a day
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me 
Quite amazed
As I'm unwashed and somewhat slightly dazed

I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you could spend the morning talking with me 
Quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad and somewhat slightly dazed

Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching
So now, you should spend the mornings lying to your father
Quite amazed
About the strange unwashed and happily slightly dazed"
Letter to Hermione,"The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head and read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do? 
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you

They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired

You cry a little in the dark
Well, so do I
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay

He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss
It's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake? 
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do
So I'll just write some love to you"

Janine,"Oh my love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wanderer
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand

Your strange demand
To 'collocate' my mind
Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll have to keep you in your place
I've no defence
I've got to keep my veil on my face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crush the walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

You're fey, Janine
A trouper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
For you're a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown

So stay, Janine
And we can glide along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crush the walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all"
Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud,"Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the wild eyed boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope into its bag
Blows his pipe of smoulders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh it's the madness in his eyes
As he breaks the night to cry:

It's really me
Really you
And really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you
And really me
You'll lose me though I'm always really free

And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realise
Where the snow had saved a place
For the wild eyed boy from Freecloud

And the village Dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the wide-eyed boy from Freecloud

And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand
And the magic in the stare
Of the wild eyed boy said
Stop, Freecloud
They won't think to cut me down

But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face of the wise boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled back to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain track"
God Knows I'm Good,"I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind

Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today

God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today

Then she moved toward the exit, clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart, it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears, the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling wooden floor

Crying
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way

God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look the other way
Hey"
An Occasional Dream,"I recall how we lived
On the corner of a bed
And we'd speak of the Swedish room
Of Hessian and wood
And we'd talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise
Some things we could do

In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An occasional dream

And we'd sleep, oh so close
But not really close our eyes
'Tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue
Gently weeping nights
It was long, long ago, long ago
And I still can't touch your name

For the days of fate were strong for you
Danced you far from me

In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream
Of mine
An occasional dream (time)
Of mine"
After All,"Please trip them gently
They don't like to fall
(Oh by jingo)
There's no room for anger
We're all very small
(Oh by jingo)
We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies
From paradise
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball
Won't someone invite them
They're just taller children
That's all
After all

Man is an obstacle
Sad as the clown
(Oh by jingo)
So hold onto nothing
And he won't let you down
(Oh by jingo)
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone
Others are running
The smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence
They're just older children
That's all
After all

I sing with impertinence
Shading impermanent chords
With my words
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called
But the thought just occurred
That we're nobody's children
After all

Live till your rebirth
And do what you will
(Oh by jingo)
Forget all I've said
Please bear me no ill
(Oh by jingo)

After all
After all"
The Width of a Circle,"In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree
And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked ""Why not?"" and I replied ""I don't know.""
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
And he laughed insane and quipped ""KAHLIL GIBRAN""
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

So I said ""So long"" and I waved ""Bye-bye""
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
Got laid by a young bordello
Who was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag
And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said ""You'll never go down to the Gods again""
(Turn around, go back!)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said ""Do it again, do it again""
(Turn around, go back!)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said ""Do it again, do it again""
(Turn around, go back!)

Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
Waiting for you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
All the Madmen,"Day after day
They send my friends away
To mansions cold and grey
To the far side of town
Where the thin men stalk the streets
While the sane stay underground

Day after day
They tell me I can go
They tell me I can blow
To the far side of town
Where it's pointless to be high
'Cause it's such a long way down
So I tell them that

I can fly, I will scream
I will break my arm
I will do me harm
Here I stand
Foot in hand
Talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all
Am I?

Don't set me free
I'm as heavy as can be
Just my librium and me
And my E.S.T. makes three

'Cause I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content they're all as sane as me

(Where can the horizon lie
When a nation hides
Its organic minds
In a cellar
Dark and grim
They must be very dim)

Day after day
They take some brain away
Then turn my face around
To the far side of town
And tell me that it's real
Then ask me how I feel

Here I stand
Foot in hand
Talking to my wall
I'm not quite right at all

Don't set me free
I'm as helpless as can be
My libido's split on me
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy

'Cause I'd rather stay here
With all the madmen
Than perish with the sad men
Roaming free
And I'd rather play here
With all the madmen
For I'm quite content
They're all as sane as me

The Man Who Sold the World,"We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone, a long, long time ago

Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
I searched for form and land, for years & years, I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
We must have died alone, a long, long time ago

Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world"
She Shook Me Cold,"We met upon a hill
The night was cool and still
She sucked my dormant will
Mother, she blew my brain
I will go back again
My God, she shook my cold

I had no time to spare
I grabbed her golden hair
And threw her to the ground
Father, she caved my head
Oh Lord, the things she said
My God, she should be told

I was very smart
Broke the gentle hearts
Of many young virgins
I was quick on the ball
Left them so lonely
They'd just give up trying
Then she took my head
Smashed it up
Kept my young blood rising
Crushed me mercilessly
Kept me going around
So she don't know I crave her so

I'll give my love in vain
To reach that peak again
We met upon a hill
Mother, she blew my brain
I will go back again
My God, she shook me cold"
Running Gun Blues,"I count the corpses on my left 
I find I'm not so tidy
So I better get away
Better make it today
I've cut twenty-three down since Friday
But I can't control it
My face is drawn
My instinct still emotes it

I slash them cold
I kill them dead
I broke the gooks
I cracked their heads
I'll bomb them out from under the beds
But now I've got the running gun blues

It seems the peacefuls stopped the war
Left generals squashed and stifled
But I'll slip out again tonight
'Cause they haven't taken back my rifle
For I promote oblivion
And I'll plug a few civilians

I'll slash them cold
I'll kill them dead
I'll break them gooks
I'll crack their heads
I'll slice them till they're running red
But now I've got the running gun blues"
Saviour Machine,"President Joe once had a dream
The world held his hand, gave their pledge
So he told them his scheme for a Saviour Machine

They called it the Prayer, its answer was law
Its logic stopped war, gave them food
How they adored till it cried in its boredom

Please don't believe in me, please disagree with me
Life is too easy, a plague seems quite feasible now
Or maybe a war, or I may kill you all

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine

I need you flying, and I'll show that dying
Is living beyond reason, sacred dimension of time
I perceive every sign, I can steal every mind

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away
Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine"
The Prettiest Star,"Cold fire, you've got everything but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace, child
I moved up to take a place
Near you

So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tried
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart
In pieces

Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The prettiest star

One day, though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star

Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
Prettiest star

One day, though it might as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The prettiest star"
The Supermen ,"When all the world was very young
And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with superfear 
Their endless tragic lives
Could heave nor sigh
In solemn, perverse serenity
Wondrous beings chained to life

Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a supergod cries

Where all were minds in uni-thought
Power weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh
A chance to die
To turn to mold

Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod cries

Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod dies"
Black Country Rock,"Pack a pack horse up and rest up here on
Black Country Rock
You never know, you might find it here on
Black Country Rock

Some say the view is crazy
But you may adopt another point of view
So if it's much too hazy
You can leave my friend and me with fond adieu"
Quicksand,"I'm closer to the Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowley's uniform of imagery
I'm living in a silent film
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm of dream reality

I'm frightened by the total goal
Drawing to the ragged hole
And I ain't got the power anymore
No I ain't got the power anymore

I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
Living proof of Churchill's lies; I'm destiny
I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets in divine symmetry

Should I kiss the viper's fang
Or herald loud the death of Man
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah

I'm not a prophet or a stone age man
Just a mortal with potential of a superman; I'm living on
I'm tethered to the logic of homo sapiens
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation of bullshit faith

If I don't explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it on the next Bardo
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah"
Life on Mars?,"It's a God-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling ""No!""
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a sadd'ning bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dancehall
Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the
Lawman beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know
Who's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?"
Song for Bob Dylan,"Oh, hear this, Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
His words of truthful vengeance
They could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

You gave your heart to every bedsit room
At least a picture on the wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
The paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising
We'd rather be scared
Together than alone

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Now hear this, Robert Zimmerman
Though I don't suppose we'll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he'd gaze a while down the old street
Tell him we've lost his poems
So we're writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
Give us back our family
You're every nation's refugee
Don't leave us with their sanity

Ah, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Ah, a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

Oh, here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes"
The Bewlay Brothers,"And so the story goes they wore the clothes
They said the things to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie like they hope it was
And the Goodmen Tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of Brawn were nicer shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep to our latent fuss
Sighing, the swirl through the streets
Like the crust of the sun
The Bewlay Brothers
In our Wings that Bark
Flashing teeth of Brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, And we were Gone
Hanging out with your Dwarf Men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions

I was Stone and he was Wax
So he could scream, and still relax, unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old and dust would flow
Through our veins and Lo! it was midnight
Back at the kitchen door
Like the grim face on the Cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote
Cannot be found today
And it was Stalking time for the Moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
In the Devil-may-be-here
But He can't sing about that
Oh, And we were Gone
Real Cool Traders
We were so Turned On
You thought we were Fakers

Now the dress is hung, the ticket pawned
The Factor Max that proved the fact
Is melted down
And woven on the edging of my pillow
Now my Brother lays upon the Rocks
He could be dead, He could be not
He could be You
He's Chameleon, Comedian, Corinthian and Caricature
Shooting-up Pie-in-the-Sky
The Bewlay Brothers
In the feeble and the Bad
Bewlay Brothers
In the Blessed and Cold
In the Crutch-hungry Dark
Was where we flayed our Mark
Oh, and we were Gone
Kings of Oblivion
We were so Turned On
In the Mind-Warp Pavilion

Lay me place and bake me Pie
I'm starving for me Gravy
Leave my shoes, and door unlocked
I might just slip away, hey

Just for the Day, Hey!
Hey, Please come Away, Hey!
Just for the Day, Hey!
Please come Away, Hey!
Please come Away, Hey!
Just for the Day
Please come Away
Please come Away
Please come Away
Please come Away
Away
(Away)
Away
Hey"
Eight Line Poem,"The tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room
The mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between her paws
They've opened shops down West side
Will all the cacti find a home
But the key to the city
Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky"
Andy Warhol,"{This is Andy Warhol and it's take one, take one
It's, it's Warhol actually
What did I say?
Whole, it's whole as in wholes
Aa, Andy Warhol
Wah, Andy Warhol, Andy Warhol
Like whole hub
Andy Warhol like what?
He, ha
Are you ready?
Yeah, ha ha ha}

Like to take a cement fix 
Be a standing cinema 
Dress my friends up just for show 
See them as they really are 
Put a peephole in my brain 
Two new Pence to have a go
Like to be a gallery 
Put you all inside my show

Andy Warhol looks a scream 
Hang him on my wall 
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen 
Can't tell them apart at all

Andy walking, Andy tired 
Andy take a little snooze 
Tie him up when he's fast asleep 
Send him on a pleasant cruise 
When he wakes up on the sea 
Sure to think of me and you 
He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

Andy Warhol looks a scream 
Hang him on my wall 
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen 
Can't tell them apart at all"
Queen Bitch,"I'm up on the eleventh floor 
And I'm watching the cruisers below 
He's down on the street 
And he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh, my heart's in the basement 
My weekend's at an all time low 
'Cause she's hoping to score 
So I can't see her letting him go 

Walk out of her heart 
Walk out of her mind 
Oh, not her

She's so swishy in her satin and tat 
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat 
Oh God, I could do better than that
Oh yeah

She's an old-time ambassador of sweet talking, night walking games
Oh and she's known in the darkest clubs for pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it, then she can do it
She don't make false claims 
But she's a queen, and such are queens, that your laughter is sucked in their brains 

Now she's leading him on 
And she'll lay him right down 
Yes, she's leading him on 
And she'll lay him right down 
But it could have been me 
Yes, it could have been me 
Why didn't I say? Why didn't I say?
No, no, no 

She's so swishy in her satin and tat 
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat 
Oh God, I could do better than that 

So I lay down a while and I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold, it don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah, I lay down a while and I look at my hotel wall
But he's down on the street so I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab 'cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth and it's no taste at all
It could have been me, oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say
No, no, no 

She's so swishy in her satin and tat 
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat 
Oh God, I could do better than that"
Kooks,"Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing

We bought a lot of things to keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules
On what to say to people when they pick on you
'Cause if you stay with us, you're gonna be pretty kookie, too

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing

And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up this old fool
Don't pick fights with the bullies or the cads
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching
Other people's dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire
And take the car downtown

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing

Will you stay in our lovers' story
If you stay, you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow, so take a chance
With a couple of kooks
Hung up on romancing

Will you stay"
Holy Holy,"Listen Lady, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be lie-high-high-high-high-high, my! Oh my!
Slowly, we get too good and too holy
Helping one another, just a righteous brother
Night time, get me back in the night time
I don't want to be angel, just a little bit evil
I feel the devil in me

Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
Let go of me

Listen Lady, let me lie low, lie low with you
To be a lie-high-high-high-high-high, my! Oh my!

Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy, holy
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone
Let go of me"
Moonage Daydream,"I'm an alligator, I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut, you're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words

Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

Don't fake it baby, lay the real thing on me
The church of man love is such a holy place to be
Make me, baby, make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air

Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

Freak out
Far out
In out"
Hang On to Yourself,"Oh, she's a tongue twisting storm
Comes to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money 
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on the 'lectric dream

Come on, come on
We really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself

We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play
Then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well, the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the blessed, we're the Spiders From Mars

Come on, come on
We really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself

C'mon 

Come on, come on
Really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself

Come on, come on
We really got a good thing going
Come on, come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself"
Changes,"Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet

So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
How the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

Ooh yeah

I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still, the days seem the same

And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware what they're going through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

Strange fascination fascinating me
Oh, changes are taking the pace I'm going through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now, you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time"
Oh! You Pretty Things,"Wake up, you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee

I look out my window, what do I see?
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the golden ones

Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned what we work here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain, you got to make way for the Homo superior

Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself, they belong to you
They're the start of a coming race

The earth is a bitch, we've finished our news
Homo sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Oh, you pretty things (Oh, you pretty things)
Don't you know you're driving your mamas and papas insane
Let me make it plain, you got to make way for the Homo superior"
Lady Stardust,"People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
Lady stardust sang songs
Of darkness and disgrace

And he was all right, the band was all together
Yes, he was all right, the song went on forever
Yes, he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long

Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady stardust sang songs
Of darkness and dismay

And he was all right, the band was all together
Yes, he was all right, his song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite paradise
And he sang all night long

Oh, how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name

Oh there was all right, the band was all together
Yes, he was all right, and his song went on forever
He was awful nice
Really quite paradise
He sang all night long"
Ziggy Stardust,"Oh
Oh, yeah

Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band

Ziggy really sang
Screwed-up eyes and screwed-down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded, man
Well-hung and snow-white tan

So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh

Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was the nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But, boy, could he play guitar

Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind, ah
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

Oh, yeah
Ooh

Ziggy played guitar"
Rock n Roll Suicide,"Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe, but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead, so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural, religiously unkind

Oh no, love, you're not alone
You're watching yourself, but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up, but if I could only make you care
Oh no, love, you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone

Just turn on with me, and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Gimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderful (Wonderful)
Oh, gimme your hands"
Suffragette City,"Hey man
Oh, leave me alone, you know
Hey man
Oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man

This mellow-thighed chick just put my spine out of place

Hey man
My schoolday's insane
Hey man
My work's down the drain
Hey man
Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she

Oh, don't lean on me, man

Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City

Star,"Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile as a rock 'n' roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that he tried

I could make a transformation as a rock 'n' roll star
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock 'n' roll star
Get it all, yeah
Ooh, yeah
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd come on like a regular superstar

Soul Love,"Stone love, she kneels before the grave
A brave son, who gave his life to see the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving

New love, a boy and girl are talking
New words, that only they can share in 
New words, a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep through the fleeting hours of morning

Love is careless in it's choosing, sweeping over 'cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love, and love is not loving

Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love, and how my God on high is
All love, though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him

Love is careless in it's choosing, sweeping over 'cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love, and love is not loving"
Starman,"Hey my love
Goodbye love

Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll, ""Lotta soul,"" he said
Then the loud sound it seemed to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive

There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

I had to phone someone, so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him, too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle, he may land tonight
Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright

There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie"
Five Years,"Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in

News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying

I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there

And all the fat-skinny people
And all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off
I think she would have killed them

A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that

I think I saw you in an ice cream parlour
Drinking milk shakes, cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song

And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got

We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got

We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got

We've got five years, what a surprise

The Jean Genie,"A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie, woohoo

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie, woohoo

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go

Go

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks

Panic in Detroit,"Ooh

He looked a lot like Che Guevara, drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions, they followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

Putting on some clothes, I made my way to school
I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights

Having scored a trillion dollars, made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table, a gun and me alone
I ran to the window, looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit, he'd left me an autograph
""Let me collect dust,"" I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit

Aladdin Sane (1913–1938–197?),"Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet
Dead roses

Saki and strings divine
You'll make it

Passionate bright young things
Takes him away to war
Don't fake it

Sadden glissando strings
You'll make it

Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?

Motor sensational
Paris or maybe hell
I'm waiting

Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane
You'll make it

Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?

Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?

Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane?

Watch That Man,"Shakey threw a party that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old-fashioned band of married men
Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so

The ladies looked bad but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so

Yeah! It was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! So it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame

Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands
Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits were joking, the manholes were smoking
Every bottle battled with the reason why

The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played a Tiger Rag
And the villains on the screen stopped bleeding

Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! And I ran to the street, looking for information

Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!
He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man
Watch that man

Cracked Actor,"I've seen all the rest of my Hollywood highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff from my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty, 'cause you just got paid

Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack is all that you'll feel 
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head 
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
Please stay

You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since you pinned your baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions, a sack full of cheques
You made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex

Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack is all that you'll feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh, stay
Please stay
For a day
Oh yeah
Don't you care?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo!
Oh yeah"
Lady Grinning Soul,"She'll come, she'll go.
She'll lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky oil
The lady from another grinning soul

Cologne she'll wear. Silver and Americard
She'll drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta

And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast.
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end

She'll come, she'll go.
She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become
Her point of view

And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast.
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end (repeat)"
Drive-In Saturday,"Let me put my arms around your head
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh, babe, it'll be all right
Pour me out another phone
I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone
And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw

His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday

Jung the foreman prayed at work
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation
Amid this fallout saturation
Cursing at the Astronette
That stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The Bureau Supply for aging men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Where once had raged a sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw

His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday

His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday, yeah
Yeah

Drive-in Saturday
It's a drive-in Saturday
Drive, drive-in Saturday (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a drive-in Saturday, yeah (It's a drive-in Saturday)
It's a, it's a, it's a, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir (It's a drive-in Saturday)

We Are the Dead,"Something kind of hit me today
I looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way
People will hold us to blame
It hit me today, it hit me today

We're taking it hard all the time
Why don't we pass it by?
Just reply, you've changed your mind
We're fighting with the eyes of the blind
Taking it hard, taking it hard

Yet now
We feel that we are paper, choking on you nightly
They tell me ""Son, we want you, be elusive, but don't walk far""
For we're breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin
For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy
You're just an ally of the leecher
Locator for the virgin King, but I love you in your fuck-me pumps
And your nimble dress that trails
Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead

One thing kind of touched me today
I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
Pressing our love through the night
Knowing it's right, knowing it's right

Now I'm hoping someone will care
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared
Trusting on the sons of our love
That someone will care, someone will care

But now
We're today's scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow's double feature
Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell
It's a twenty-four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell
And the streets are full of press men
Bent on getting hung and buried
And the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt
Who sucks you while you're sleeping
It's the theater of financiers
Count them, fifty 'round a table
White and dressed to kill

Oh caress yourself, my juicy
For my hands have all but withered
Oh dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead
We are the dead
We are the dead"
Rock n Roll with Me,"You always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet
I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand

When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me

Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting
I've found a door which lets me out!

When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me

Oh, when you rock 'n' roll with me,
There's no one else I'd rather be, oh
Nobody down here can do it for me
When you rock 'n' roll with me

When you rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather, I'd rather be
Nobody down here can do it for me
I'm in tears, I'm in tears
When you rock 'n' roll with me"

You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of 'ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?

So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you?
Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh how could they know?
Eh, eh"
Sweet Thing,"It's safe in the city to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger?
Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the center of things
Where the knowing one says

Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment
If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads, and hamburgers, and...

Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing"
Sweet Thing (Reprise),"If you want it, boys, get it here thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

Is it nice in your snow storm, freezing your brain?
Do you think that your face looks the same?
Then let it be, it's all I ever wanted
It's a street with a deal, and a taste
It's got claws, it's got me, it's got you"
1984,"Someday they won't let you, now you must agree

And tell that you're 80, but, brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's never there

Diamond Dogs,"As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicon hump and your ten-inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was,
Todd Browning's freak you was.

Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will,
Mannequins with kill appeal

Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone

Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh Tarzie, go man go

Meets his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed
Diamond Dogs are civilised

Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone

Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs

Oh! Who!
Ooh ...

In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
There's gonna be sorrow
Try and wake up tomorrow

Will they come? - I keep a friend serene
Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone

Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog

Candidate,"I'll make you a deal like any other candidate.
We'll pretend were walking home cause your future's at stake
My set is amazing, it even smells like the street
There is a bar at the end where I could meet you and your friend.
Someone scrawled on the wall ""I smell the blood of les tricoteuses""
Who wrote up scandals in other bars

I am having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces Charles Manson, Cassius Clay
If you want it, boys get it here thing.

So you scream out of line
""I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Anytime?
Tres butch little numberwang ""Hey girlie, I want you
When it's good it's really good and when it's bad I go to pieces""
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar.
Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying till we break up our minds
Till the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding hands"
All the Young Dudes,"Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Don't want to stay alive when you're 25

Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face
A funky little boat race

The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
But, man, I need a TV when I've got T. Rex

Big Brother,"Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don't live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulsars unreal
He'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
He'll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin
Then we can really begin

Please saviour, saviour, show us 
Hear me, I'm graphically yours 
Someone to claim us, someone to follow 
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us, someone like you
We want you, Big Brother, Big Brother

I know you think you're awful square 
But you made everyone and you've been everywhere
Lord, I'd take an overdose if you knew what's going down

Someone to claim us, someone to follow
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool us, someone like you

Someone to claim us, someone to follow
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo
Someone to fool, someone like you

Someone to claim us, someone to follow 
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo 
Someone to fool, someone like you
We want you, Big Brother"
Future Legend,"spoken:
And in the death,
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy thoroughfare,
The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building
High on Poacher's Hill
And red mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City
No more big wheels.

Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox -now legwarmers
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald
Any day now

The Year of the Diamond Dogs

This ain't rock'n'roll - this is genocide."
Young Americans,"They pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
""Gee, my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young?""
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)

But she wants the young American

Scanning life through the picture window (Doo doo doo doo)
She finds the slinky vagabond (Doo doo doo doo)
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak and his type, all for nothing (Doo doo doo doo)
Misses a step and cuts his hand, but (Doo doo doo doo)
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song, she cries
""Where have all Papa's heroes gone?""

(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yeah, ah-yeah
(She wants the young American)
All right
(All right)
Well, she wants the young American

All the way from Washington
Her breadwinner begs off the bathroom floor
""We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?"", well

(All night)
He wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
Yes, he does, ah
(He wants the young American)
Mmm mmm mmm
(All right) Well, all right
Well, he wants the young American

Do you remember your President Nixon? (Doo doo doo doo)
Do you remember the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?

Have you been the un-American? (Doo doo doo doo)
Just you and your idol sing falsetto 'bout (Doo doo doo doo)
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor (Doo doo doo doo)
In case, just in case of depression? (Doo doo doo doo)
Sit on your hands on the bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro Sheeners
Ain't that close to love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, ain't that poster love? (Doo doo doo doo)
Well, it ain't that Barbie Doll
Her heart's been broken just like you and

(All night)
All night, you want the young American

All right, ah

You ain't a pimp, and you ain't a hustler

A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler

Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache

I got a suite and-ah you got defeat

Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And ain't there a child I can hold without judging-ah?
(Young American, young American)
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
(All right)
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?

Velvet Goldmine,"You got crazy legs, you got amazin' head
You got rings on your fingers and your hair's hot red
You got the width of my tongue name on the sun
I clutch you close to my breast
'Cause you're the only one, who uses school to pleasure

You make me act real gone, you make me troll along
I had to ravish your capsule, suck you dry
Feel the teeth in your bones, heal ya head with my own
Why if I don't have you whole, is that your final love?
Here all together

Velvet goldmine, you stroke me like the rain
Snake it, take it, panther princess you must stay
Velvet goldmine, naked on your chain
I'll be your king volcano right for you again and again

You're my taste, my trip, I'll be your master zip
I'll chop your hair off for kicks, you'll make me jump to my feet
So you'll give me your hand, give me your sound
Let my sea wash your face, I'm falling, I can't stand
Ooh! Clutch your makeup!

Velvet goldmine, you stroke me like the rain
Snake it, take it, panther princess you must stay

I'll be your king volcano right for you again and again

Station to Station,"The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
Here are we, one magical moment, such is the stuff
From where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean, lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no colour
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean

Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkhuth
There are you, you drive like a demon from station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke, making sure white stains

Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sunbirds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
Oh, what will I be believing and who will connect me with love?
Wonderful, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high

It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here

I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here

Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here

Stay,"This week dragged past me so slowly

Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me

If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

""Stay,"" that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is ""stay this time""
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

Heart-wrecker, heart-wrecker, make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

""Stay,"" that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is ""stay this time""
I really meant to, so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants so much to

You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems
I'll never touch you"

Through morning's thoughts and fantasies

What in the World,"You're just a little girl with grey eyes
Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries
Oh, wait until the crowd cries
You're just a little girl with grey eyes

So deep in your room, you never leave your room
Something deep inside of me - yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can you do
What in the world can you do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

Oh

I'm just a little bit afraid of you
Cause love won't make you cry
But, wait until the crowd goes

Under the cool, under the cool and under having a ball
What you gonna say to the real me, to the real me

Blackout,"You
You walk on past
Your lips cut a smile on your face
Your scalding face
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage
Too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
Your fearful hands
Get me to a doctor's I've been told
Someone's back in town
The chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I'm under Japanese influence
And my honour's at stake

The weather's grim ice on the cages
Me I'm Robin Hood and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming

If you don't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose
Nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
In the rain
Get me to the doctor

Get me off the streets (get some protection)
Get me on my feet (get some direction)
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Get me off the streets
Get some protection
Get me on my feet
While the streets block off
Getting some skin exposure
To the blackout
Get me on my feet
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets (get some protection)"
Sons of the Silent Age,"Sons of the silent age
Stand on platforms blank looks and note books
Sit in back rows of city limits
Lay in bed coming and going on easy terms
Sons of the silent age
Pace their rooms like a cell's dimensions
Rise for a year or two then make war
Search through their one inch thoughts
Then decide it couldn't be done

Baby, I'll never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down (sons of sound and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, I'll never let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's find another way (sons of sound and sons of sound)

Sons of the silent age
Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy and King Dice
Sons of the silent age
Pick up in bars and cry only once
Sons of the silent age
Make love only once but dream and dream
Don't walk, they just glide in and out of life
They never die, they just go to sleep one day

Baby, I won't ever let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down (sons of sound and sons of sound)
Oh baby, baby, baby, I won't ever let you down

Sound and Vision,"Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?

Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head

Don't you wonder sometimes
About sound and vision?"

Every chance that I take
I take it on the road
Those kilometers and the red lights
I was always looking

As I put my foot down to the floor
I was going round and round the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to ninety-four
But I'm always crashing in the same car"

African Night Flight,"African nightmare, one-time Mormon
More men fall in hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman, I went too far

Bent on a windfall, rent a Sony
Wonder how the dollar went down
Gotta get a word to Elizabeth's father
Hey ho, he wished me well

Seems like another day, I could fly
Into the eye of God on high

His burning eye will see me through

Bare strip takeoff, skimming over rhino
Born in slumber less than peace

Struggle with a child whose screaming, dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine

Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life, quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one left unnamed

Seems like another day, I could fly
Into the eye of God on high
Seems like another day, I could fly
Into the eye of God on high

Over the bushland, over the trees
Wise like orangutan, that was me

His burning eye will see me through

Look Back in Anger,"""You know who I am,"" he said.
The speaker was an angel:
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings,
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
""It's time we should be going.""

(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
""Look back in anger,
Driven by the night,
Till you come.""
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
""Look back in anger
See it in my eyes
Till you come.""

No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me

(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)

""Look back in anger
Driven by the night,
Till you come""

(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)

""Look back in anger
Feel it in my voice,
Till you come."""
Repetition,"Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through you
When you ask him how the kids are

He'll get home around seven
'Cause the Chevy's real old
And he could have had a Cadillac
If the school had taught him right
And he could have married Anne
With the blue silk blouse

And the food is on the table
But the food is cold
Don't hit her

""Can't you even cook?
What's the good of me working
When you can't damn cook?""
Well Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes
Shows through

And he could have married Anne
With the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne
With the blue silk blouse

Shows through
Shows through
Shows through"

Yassassin - but such a life I've never known

We came from the farmlands
To live in this city
We walked proud and lustful
In this resonant world
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away

Yassassin - I'm not a moody guy
Yassassin - I walk without a sound
Yassassin - just a working man, no judge of men
Yassassin - but such a life I've never known

Look at this - no second glances
Look at this - no value of love
Look at this - just sun and steel
Look at this - then look at us

If there's someone in charge
Then listen to me
Don't say nothing's wrong
'Cause I've got a love
And she's afeared
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away

Yassassin - just a working man, no judge of men

Move On,"Sometimes I feel
That I need to move on
So I pack a bag
And move on
Move on

Well I might take a train
Or sail at dawn
Might take a girl
When I move on
When I move on

Somewhere, someone's calling me
And when the chips are down
I'm just a travelling man
Maybe it's just a trick of the mind
And somewhere there's a morning sky
Bluer than her eyes
Somewhere there's an ocean
Innocent and wild

Africa is sleepy people
Russia has its horsemen
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
Sleeping on the matted ground

Cyprus is my island
When the going's rough
I would love to find you
Somewhere in a place like that

Somewhere, someone's calling me
And when the chips are down
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you
Feeling like a shadow
Drifting like a leaf
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you"

Fantastic Voyage,"In the event that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion and we never get old
Remember it's true, dignity is valuable
But our lives are valuable, too.

We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose

It's a very modern world, but nobody is perfect
It's a moving world, but that's no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It won't be forgotten
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again, will we?

And the wrong words make you listen
In this criminal world
Remember it's true, a loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable, too.

We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose

But any sudden movement, and I've got to write it down
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write down
And it won't be forgotten
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again, how can I?"

And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away
I really can't remember
Last time I saw the light of day

But I remember Sam 'cause he was like me

Screaming like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun

Well they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded, chains, and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And oh I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes

Now I'm learning to be a part of soc-society
Soc socie s

Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun

No athletic program, no discipline, no book
He just sat in the backseat swearing he'd seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace
Singing old songs we loved

Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun"
Teenage Wildlife,"Well, how come you only want tomorrow
With its promise of something hard to do
A real life adventure worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above, sun on your arms strength in your stride
And hope in those squeaky clean eyes
You'll get chilly receptions everywhere you go
Blinded with desire - I guess the season is on

So you trade by shadow boxing, search for the truth
But it's all, but it's all used up
Break open your million dollar weapon
And push your luck, still you push, still you push your luck
A broken nosed mogul are you
One of the new wave boys

Same old thing in brand new drag
Comes sweeping into view, oh-ooh
As ugly as a teenage millionaire
Pretending it's a whizz kid world
You'll take me aside, and say
""Well, David, what shall, shall I do?
They wait for me in the hallway""
I'll say ""Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways""
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner
And I feel like a group of one, no-no
They can't do this to me
I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife

Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes
And the word is that the hunted one is out there on his own
And you're alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you daren't look behind

You fall to the ground like a leaf from the tree
And look up one time at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No no, I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife
I'm not a piece of teenage wildlife

And no one will have seen and no one will confess
The fingerprints will prove that you couldn't pass the test
There'll be others on the line filing past, who'll whisper low
'I miss you he had to go'
Well each to his own, he was
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-oh
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-oh
Another piece of teenage wild...

Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

Time and again, I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
I'm happy, hope you're happy, too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol

I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in Heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

My mother said, ""To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom""
My mother said, ""To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom""
My mother said, ""To get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom""

Cat People (Putting Out Fire),"See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
It's been so long

Feel my blood enraged
It's just the fear of losing you
Don't you know my name
Well, you been so long

And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline

See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long

Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
Well you wouldn't believe what I've been through
You've been so long
Well it's been so long

And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline
Putting out fire
With gasoline

See these tears so blue
An ageless heart
That can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgement made
Can never bend

See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through

You've been so long
Well, it's been so long
And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline
Putting out fire with gasoline

Shake It,"I feel like a sail-boat
Adrift on the sea
It's a brand new day
So when you gonna phone me

I could take you to heaven
I could spin you to hell
But I'll take you to New York
It's the place that I know well

Sitting on a flagstone talking to a faceless girl
And I wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well

Duck and I sway - what's my line
Shoot at a full moon - what's my line
So what's my line - shake it baby

Cause love is the answer
Love's talking to me
I'd scream and I'll fight for you
You're better than money

We're the kind of people who can shake it if we're feeling blue
When I'm feeling disconnected well I sure know what to do

Shake it baby
Ah shake it shake it
I duck and I sway - what's my line
I shoot at a full moon - what's my line
So what's my line - shake it shake it baby
Shake shake it
Shake it baby
Shake shake it
Shake it baby
Shake it shake it"
China Girl,"Oh oh oh oh, little China girl
Oh oh oh oh, little China girl

I could escape this feeling with my China girl
I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating loud as thunder
Saw these stars crashing

I'm a mess without my little China girl
Wake up in the morning where's my little China girl
I hear her heart's beating loud as thunder
I saw the stars crashing down

I feel tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
And I could pretend nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl

I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes

My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
You know
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world

And when I get excited
My little China girl says
""Oh baby, just you shut your mouth""
She says, ""shh""
She says, ""shh""
She says
She says

And when I get excited
My little China girl says
""Oh baby, just you shut your mouth""
And when I get excited
My little China girl says
""Oh baby, just you shut your mouth""
She says, ""shh""

Ricochet,"Like weeds on a rockface waiting for the scythe 
Ricochet - ricochet
The world is on a corner waiting for jobs 
Ricochet - ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
And who can bear to be forgotten

March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep
Dreaming of tramlines factories pieces of machinery
Mine shafts things like that
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet - it's not the end of the world

Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole 
Ricochet - ricochet
These are the prisons these are the crimes
Teaching life in a violent new way 
Ricochet - ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
And who can bear to be forgotten

March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Early, before the sun, they struggle off to the gates
In their secret fearful places they see their lives
Unravelling before them
March of flowers - march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil breaking parole
Ricochet it's not the end of the world

That's when they get home, damp eyed and weary
They smile and crush their children to their heaving chests
Making unfulfillable promises
For who can bear to be forgotten"
Without You,"Just when I'm ready to throw in my hand
Just when the best things in life are gone
I look into your eyes

There's no smoke without fire
You're exactly who I want to be with
Without you
What would I do

And when I'm willing to call it a day
Just when I won't take another chance
I hold your hand
There's no smoke without fire
Woman I love you
Without you
What would I do"

Loving the Alien,"Watching them come and go
The Templars and the Saracens
They're traveling the holy land
Opening telegrams oh ho

Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of Coeur de Leon
Salvation for the mirror blind oh ho

But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)
And your prayers they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan

Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays oh ho
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail oh ho

But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear oh ho
Prayers they hide the saddest view

And your prayers they break the sky in two

Tumble and Twirl,"I've seen the city
I took the next flight
For Borneo
They say it's pretty
I like the t-shirts
In Borneo
Some wear Bob Marley
Others in Playboy
Or Duvalier
Make the last plane come
Let me rise through the cloudy above
With a book on Borneo

Strangers come and go
It's such a waste of time
Problems far behind
Another day
But even in springtime
It's a rich slice of life
So send me a letter
I'll reply with a broken spear
That dusky mulatto
In nylons and tattoos
Hot juice in coke bottles
We dance in the sand
Well, they twirl and they tumble
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble

I've been to Leon's
He's got nine daughters
And a stereo
They say that Leon
Watches from the tree tops
In Borneo
When the road is mud
Everything stops with a thud
That's the way it goes down yonder in Borneo
Far beneath his mansion
There's an open drain
Sending all the sewage down the hill
But when the general shows movies
No one hesitates
To sneak from the jungle
They laugh and they mumble
Enjoying the show
And that dusky mulatto

Hot juice in coke bottles
In Blue Jeans and tattoos
Well, they twirl and they tumble
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble

I like the free world
They say it's pretty
This time of year
They tumble and twirl
They tumble and twirl
I'll tumble and twirl

They twirl and they tumble
They twirl and they tumble

I like the free world
I like the free world

They say it's pretty
This time of year

This Is Not America ( Pat Metheny Group  & David Bowie) ,"This is not America, sha la la la la

A little piece of you
The little peace in me
Will die (This is not a miracle)
For this is not America

Blossom fails to bloom this season
Promise not to stare
Too long (This is not America)
For this is not the miracle

There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

For this is not America
Sha la la la la, sha la la la la, sha la la la la
This is not America, no
This is not, sha la la la la

Snowman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals to the ground

So bloody red, tomorrow's clouds

A little piece of you
The little piece in me
Will die (This could be a miracle)

A wind that blew so young
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

When the Wind Blows,"So long child, I'm on my way
And after all is done, after all is done
Don't be down, it's all in the past
Though you may be afraid

So long child, it's awful dark
And I've never felt the sun
I dread to think of when
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the wind blows

Life burns a savage wound, angry and wrong
Trusting a twisted word, you'll run, run away
You'll take it all home
You'll spin a tall tale
But they won't believe you
No matter what you'll say

So long child, it's awful dark
I never felt the sun
I dread to think of when
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the wind blows"

Sail over heartaches

A love that will last

I'll spin you Valentine evenings
Though we're strangers 'til now

Glass Spider,"Up until one century ago there lived,
In the Zi Duang province of eastern country
A glass-like spider
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web
In weeks creating a macabre

Shrine of remains
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers
Like floors in a building

At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with almost apparent
Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops
One could almost call it an altar
When the breeze blew through this construction
It produced sounds of wailing, crying
Tiny wails, tiny cries

The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically
For their mother.
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies
Would survive someone on their own.
Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a human's.
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries.

Don't you hear this wasted cry, Life is over you
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell
(Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now)
Take care, take care.
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone.
But you, you've promise in your lovin' eye. God it's dark now.

Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone, Gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone
Stay low on the ground, fire can drive you, savage and afraid
Spitting the dawn, come come come along before the animals awake
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left.
If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone

Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Too Dizzy,"There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
I'm not trying to lose control
But you're just pushin' pushin' pushin'for a fight
You look trapped, turn the radio on
Too much smoke, air conditioning gone
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking looking looking for a break

Is it love or is it what
Who's this guy I'm gonna blow away hey
What kind of love is he giving you
I'm-a-dizzy's what I'm trying to say
I said
Too Dizzy-You can't have a lover
I'm too Dizzy-It's me and no other
I'm a bad loser-I'm-a-shakin' in anger
I'm a too Dizzy-you can't have no lover

You can go on dreaming every night
But I'm not letting you out of my sight
I'm-a-ten times the man than any guy around
But you're just itchin'-twitchin'-itchin' for a break

There's too much talking for a night drive
And too much mist in front of my eyes
But I'm helpless in love with you

Zeroes,"(Ladies and Gentlemen)
(Tonight, yes, the Zeroes will be singing for you!)

Yeah Yeah (x4)

You've arrived in the land of a thousand different names
And the fabulous sons have crashed their planes in flames
Now tomorrow's back claiming redemption is on your heels
And a toothless past is asking you how it feels
And me my little red Corvette has driven by
My fair weather heart has fallen in
My rainy day girl is feeling down
And she tells me that the world is spinning round
I say the dream was all for you
You're nobody else
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you

Yeah Yeah
Yeah

Hi, can I walk you home again today
Gotta get forgive and forget hey-hey
Something good is happening I don't know what it is
Don't you know we're back on trial again today
And it's breaking wine for you
Hell it's only 'cause you're true
Someone outtimed my heart
Stopping and preaching and letting love in
You are my moon, you are my sun
Heaven knows what you are
Tonight the Zeroes are singing for you
Yes they were
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you

Doesn't matter what you try to do
Doesn't matter what you try to do
Doesn't matter where you try to go
Doesn't matter who we really are

Doesn't matter (repeat ad lib)
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter"
Julie,"Julie
Oh
And I know 

Like a mirror, Sunday morning
When the dark clouds hung above
I saw you kneeling 'neath a garden
I saw the grim and stood above

What kind of meaning in a gun shot
It doesn't matter what they say
I never felt I aimed at no one
And who's gonna take the gun away

Julie
Pretend for me
That I'm someone in your life

Julie
I'm yours till the end
All the days and memories

I'm not a man of single reason
It's in every single man
This beat of jealous retribution
And every spurned heart makes its plan

Well, I know that you really loved him
And I know that if there's a God above
Through million times we'll remember
How the trail slips away

Julie
Pretend for me
Even only for a while

Julie
My soul is on the line
All the days and memories

Julie
Remember me
All the days of your life

Day-In Day-Out,"Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out

Day-in, ooh ooh
Day-out, ooh ooh ooh

She was born in a handbag, love left on a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup, nothing seems to make a dent
Gonna find her some money honey, try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about

Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out

Day-in, ooh ooh
Day-out, ooh ooh ooh

First thing she learns is she's a citizen,
Some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
Someone rings a bell and it's all over
She's going out her way
Stealing for that one good rush

Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out

She could use a little money
She's hangin' on his arms like a cheap suit
She's got no money, honey, she's on the other side
Oh come on little baby
Late night, big town, police, shake down

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out

She's got a ticket to nowhere
She's gonna take a train ride
Nobody knows her, or knows her name
She's in the pocket of a home boy
Ooh she's gonna take her a shotgun Pow
Spin the grail spin the drug
She's gonna make them well aware
She's an angry gal

Day-in, day-out
Stay in, fade out

Suddenly there's angels everywhere
Angels in a ton of sound
And they shootin' her down
Shootin' her with video-drugs-bullets and promises"
Beat of Your Drum,"Photograph king, watches you go

Still leave a stain on me

Only to go colours may fade

Disco brat-follow the pack
Watching you peel, heaven knows, prison can't hold all this greedy intention
Only to go-I picture you now
Music may change-hi-di-ho keen to follow your nose

Wrong-love out of tune
Sweet is the night, bright light destroys me

Bombers,"All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes

Seemed a good idea
To drop a bomb on the wasteland here
Only one man could be seen
And he was old and so serene
Captain sat in his deck chair
And the red light flashed, beware
Pilot felt quite big-time
As the bomb sailed through the air
Well, they danced and sang
When the bang went bang
When the lights popped out
And the smoke began to clear
It was positively queer

All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes

""Die"" said the General
""Cobblers"" said the man
So the Pentagon sent a cable
And the Queen a telegram
A-bombs, H-bombs, even very small ones
Ripped apart that sand
Till the stench was just revolting
And the sky a greenish tan
But the soldier said ""Sir,
There's a crack in the world""
And the figures went ""squash"",
And the bits flew far and wide
How the universe sighed!

All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes

All clear wail the sirens
Sunshine on the wasteland
Old man sitting in the white sand
Think we're in for a big surprise
Right between the eyes

When the smoke had blown away
There was nothing left to view
Except a man dear Lord who looked like you
Floating high up in the sky"
Sweet Head,"I tried to break away from you
From the spics and blacks and the gum you chew
Where the posters are torn by the muggin' gangs
By the faggy parks and the burnt out vans
I've got ninety-nine years of laying in the dark and I'm far too young to lie
I've got ninety-nine ways to play my guitar it's going to pay me before I die

So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play
I'm just about the best you can hear
Gonna rock it in your head
Shazam! and come ball
With my guitar and me soprano
We can give you sweet head

I'm tough as glass and clean as night
Well if looks can love we can love all right
I'm your rubber peacock angelic whore
I'm a wrought iron face upon the wall
I had ninety-nine years of murder called life and I'm running away from it all
I got a bedroom, every mirror in town they're going to claim me if I fall

So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play
I'm just about the best you can hear
Gonna rock it in your head
Shazam! and come ball
With my guitar and me soprano
We can give you sweet head

Sweet head, give you sweet head
(Spoken: while ya down there)

See my eyes of blocked emotion, see my tremble, see my fall
Traumatics thick and fast, your faith in me can last
Besides I'm known to lay you, one and all

Look south the way your mother dwells
If she knew what's going down, she'd give you hell
I'm the kind of man she warned me of
Till there was rock, you only had god

You and I have a mutual vow
We both like young, and we both like loud
I got pretty shoes, and I'm kid and proud
I'm street side out with my ear to the crowd

So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy going to play
I'm just about the best you can hear
Gonna rock it in your head
Shazam! and come ball
With my guitar and me soprano
We can give you sweet head

Move along, sir!"

It's Gonna Be Me,"Hey Jack, I better shake it off, put her out of my head
Thinking I balled just another young girl last night
Oh brother, I left a woman in that morning bed
Been on that trip so many times
Good God, was it really yesterday?

I've tried so many, many, many, many, many, many ways
I've lied and taken off into the day
Leaving another girl to weep over the breakfast tray
Loved her before I knew her name, hit me Jack, 'cos I'm gonna love her way

Come back, my babe
Come back, my babe
Be holy again, i gave her
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Maybe, gotta give her, ooh baby, baby, baby

That kind of love, can only destroy
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Get it down if I'm gonna be her baby, 'cos, baby
Gonna be me, it's gonna be me

There was no rein to check me
When all of those little things walked on by
Oh, but I couldn't really stammer out a word
When that angel stuck in my mind
Looking for love won't hold me back
No, I'm gonna love her way

Come back, my babe
Come back, my babe
Be holy again, i gave her
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Maybe, gotta give her, ooh baby, baby, baby

That kind of love, can only destroy
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Get it down if I'm gonna be her baby, 'cos, baby
Gonna be me, it's gonna be me

Just playing that latest record
Waiting for the telephone to ring
Wiped out and bitter with a bag clutched in her hand
All the cars sound like they're pulling in the drive
No, no, no

I see her now a little tear running down her check
Lost, let down, people looking for me
I want to race down her street
And knock hard

Hard, hard on the door until
Until she breaks down into my arms like a
Treasured toy and I feel her pain
I'll be so strong, again and again

Come back my baby
I'm hold you again, I'll take you
I'll take you, baby, baby, baby
Baby, we're gonna have, ooh baby, baby, baby

My kind of love, can only bring you joy, I'm gonna
Yeah, baby, baby, yeah, I'll give you baby, baby, baby

The face of seduction was you
But I listened for each and every footstep

Questioning saintlike and fantastic heroes
Feeling like lost little children in fabled lands
So I listen for each and every friendship
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you
In my Real Cool World

Starry-eyed life but somehow believing in nothing
You whisper sweet nothing but reading between your lines
I listen color me doubtful
In this Real Cool World

Now there is you

You came from nowhere

You held me you shook me

Buddha of Suburbia (featuring  Lenny Kravitz  on guitar) ,"Living in lies by the railway line
Pushing the hair from my eyes
Elvis is English and climbs the hills
Can't tell the bullshit from the lies

Screaming along in South London
Vicious but ready to learn
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer
Sometimes but always in vain

So I'll wait until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed and all the same
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
Englishmen going insane

Down on my knees in suburbia
Down on myself in every way

With great expectations I change all my clothes
Mustn't crumble at silver and gold
Screaming above Central London
Never born, so I'll never get old

So I'll wait until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed and all the same
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
Englishmen going insane

Down on my knees in suburbia
Down on myself in every way

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

Did the world just explode?
Don't recognize anyone
But you've still got me under your thumb

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy
In this sexual noise, vicious chords offer joy
You live and you die in the blink of an eye
Well I can't make you dance 
Dance to the noise

Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
Dance to the noise
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do

Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
But you can't buy me off in this serial world
Who who who died and made you material girl?

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern song

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do

Or this shallow orb mugged by reality
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need you
Live and you die in the blink of an eye
Still I can't make you dance
Dance to the noise

Black Tie White Noise (featuring  Al B. Sure! ) ,"Getting my facts from a Benneton ad
I'm lookin' through African eyes
Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire
I've got a face, not just my race, Bang Bang I've got you babe

Sun comes up and the man goes down
And the woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear
Then we jump through hoops, we're divisable now, just disappear

We reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Then die in the flames singing ""we shall overcome""
Whoa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come through don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I look into your eyes
And I wonder sometimes

Oh Lord, just let him see me
Lord, Lord just let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together.

Reach over race and hold each other's hands
Walk through the night thinking we are the world
Woa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it
But we'll come through don't doubt it

I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I wonder why
Yes, and I wonder why sometimes

They'll show us how to break the rules
But never how to make the rules
Reduce us down to witless punks
Facist cries both black and white, who's got the blood, who's got the gun.

She's not mine for eternity
Though I'll never fly so high

Strangers When We Meet,"You, you, you
You, you, you

All our friends
Now seem so thin and frail
Slinky secrets
Hotter than the sun

No peachy prayers
No trendy rechauffé
I'm with you
So I can't go on

All my violence
Raining tears upon the sheet
I'm bewildered
For we're strangers when we meet

Blank screen TV
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you

Blended sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes

All my violence
Raining tears upon the sheet
I'm resentful
For we're strangers when we meet

Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new

Your embrace
Was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu

Steely resolve
Is falling from me
My poor soul
All bruised passivity

All your regrets
Ride rough-shod over me
I'm so glad
That we're strangers when we meet

I'm so thankful
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover
For we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over
But we're strangers when we meet

Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet

Buddha of Suburbia,"Living in lies by the railway line
Pushing the hair from my eyes
Elvis is English and climbs the hills
Can't tell the bullshit from the lies

Screaming along in South London
Vicious but ready to learn
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer
Sometimes but always in vain

So I'll wait until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed and all the same
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
Englishmen going insane

Down on my knees in suburbia
Down on myself in every way

With great expectations I change all my clothes
Mustn't crumble at silver and gold
Screaming above Central London
Never born, so I'll never get old

So I'll wait until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed and all the same
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
Englishmen going insane

Down on my knees in suburbia
Down on myself in every way

Dead Against It,"And when she drowns
Within and in the fizzy gin, begins to sigh
""Good god"" or ""My"" I cry and die and lie beside

She is the apple in my eye
She talked to God
I couldn't cope
Or'd hope eloped
A dope, she roped
This salty lie

And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her
Telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it

And deep my wound
Within for every second chance it was 
thy-tore
From deep within, despite the rain, my words are worn

She loves to talk into the phone
No matter who
No matter when
No matter where
No better than the faulty line

And when she's dreaming, I believe
And when she's reading, I retreat
Can't believe her
Telling me she's dead again
Telling me she's dead against it"
Algeria Touchshriek,"My name is Mr. Touchshriek 
Of Touchshriek mail order and fantasy
My shop sells egg shells off the shesores and empty females

I'm thinking of leasing the room above my shop 
To a Mr. Walloff Domburg
A reject from the world wide intellect

He's a broken man
I'm also a broken man

It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations
Looking through windows for demons
And watching the young advance in all electric

Some of the houses around here still have inhabitants in them
I'm not sure if they're from this country or not
I don't get to speak much to anyone or that sort of thing
If I had another broken man
Oh, I dream of something like that"
The Voyeur of Utter Destruction (as Beauty),"Turn, and turn again
Turn, and turn again

I shake and stare the sun
Till my eyes burn
I shake at the mothers
Brutal vermin

I shake and stare
At the watery moon
With the same desire
As the sober philistine

Turn, and turn again

Worm, the pain and blade
Turn, and turn again

The screw
Is a tightening atrocity
I shake
For the reeking flesh is as romantic as hell

The need
To have seen it all
The voyeur
Of utter destruction as beauty
I shake

Turn, and turn again
I shake
Turn, and turn again
I shake

I shake

This, and, Grace is my name 
And, and I was, umm
It was that phot... a fading photograph of 
A patch, patchwork quilt
And they've put me on these
Ramona put me on these interest drugs 
So I'm thinking very, too, bit too fast like a brain patch
And ah they won't let me see anybody
If, if I want to sometimes and I ask
I can still hear some pop, popular musics 
And aftershocks 
I've been watching a television of, ah, in the homelands
That's the new homelands 
And um, and that's all I can remember
And now they just want me to be quiet
And I think something is going to be horrid"

What happened when I wasn't around?
Who did what?
What went down?

A Small Plot of Land,"Poor soul
Spit upon that
Poor soul
He never knew what hit him
And it hit him so

Poor dunce
He pushed back the pigmen
The Barbs laughed
The fool is dead

Poor dunce
He's less than within us
The brains talk
But the will to live is dead
And prayer can't travel so far these days

The talk of your life
Standing so near
To innocent eyes
Poor dunce

Swings through the tunnels
And claws his way
Is small life so manic
Are these really the days?

Poor dunce

And it hit him so

Thru These Architects Eyes,"Stomping along on this big Philips Johnson
His delay just wasting my time
Looking across at Richard Rogers
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds

It's difficult you see
To give up, baby
To leave a job
When you know the money's from day to day

All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes

Cold winter bleeds on the girders of Babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and the rocks and the sand

Stomping along on this big Philips Johnson
His delay just wasting my time

It's difficult, you see
To give up, baby
These summer scumholes
This goddamned starving life

All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams in my mind's eye
All the joy I see thru these architect's eyes

It's difficult, you see

All the majesty of a city landscape

I'm deranged down down down

So cruise me babe, cruise me babe beyond

The Motel,"For we're living in a safety zone
Don't be holding back from me
We're living from hour to hour down here
And we'll take it when we can

It's a kind of living which recognizes
The death of the odorless man
When nothing is vanity, nothing's too slow
It's not Eden but it's no sham

There is no hell
There is no shame
There is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell

And it's lights up, boys
Lights up, boys

Explosion falls upon deaf ears
While we're swimming in a sea of sham
Living in the shadow of vanity
A complex fashion for a simple man

And there is no hell
And there is no shame
And there is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell

And the silence flies on its brief flight
A razor sharp crap shoot affair
And we light up our lives

And there's no more of me exploding you
Re-exposing you
Like everybody do
Re-exploding you

I don't know what to use
Make somebody move
Me exploding
Me exploding you"

Please hide
From the kiss and the bite
Shame burns
Breathing in, breathing out
Breathing in, only doubt
The pain must feel like snow
I'm no longer your golden boy
Sorry little girl
I'm sorry little girl

The pain must feel like snow
There you go
Cover me, cover me
We flew on the wings
We were deep in the dead air
And this one will never go down

But we lived unbearable lives

I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste in a tunnel
But I've been having a mid-life crisis

And I've been dreaming of sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny coloured English
We'll creep together you and I
For I know who the small friends are

I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A. Stone
A night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name, I am with name

Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads, between the centuries
A millennium fetish

You've been shot in the head
And I'm holding your brains

So I drink in the shadows
Of an evening sky
See nothing at all

The stars look so special
And the snow looks so old
The frail form is drifting
Beyond the yoga zone
Turn to question the mountain
Why pigs can fly
It's nothing at all

Dead Man Walking,"He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back 
In Atlantic City
There's not even a demon 
In Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise 
As I walk down the aisle?

And I'm gone gone gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall

And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone 
Through the crack in the past
Like a dead man walking

Like a dead man walking

Two young men 
Dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad-tempered child 
On a rain slicked street

And I'm gone gone gone
And I'm older than movies
Oh, let me dance, babe
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow

We're treading on thin ice
We're walking under golden sun
We're living in a Planet of Dreams
We're living in a Planet of Dreams
We're living in a Planet of Dreams
We're living in a Planet of Dreams
We're living in a Planet of Dreams
We're living in a Planet

Battle for Britain (The Letter),"My, my, the time do fly
When it's in another pair of hands
And a loser I will be
For I've never been a winner in my life

I got used to stressing pain
I used the sucker pills to pity for the self
Oh, it's the animal in me
But I'd rather be a beggarman on the shelf

Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
On a better day, I'll take you by the hand
And I'll walk you through the doors

Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

My, my, but time do fly
When it's in another pair of pants
And illusion I will be
For I've never been a sinner, la di da

Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down"

Seven,"I forgot what my father said
I forgot what he said
I forgot what my mother said
As we lay upon your bed

A city full of flowers
A city full of rain

I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

I forgot what my brother said
I forgot what he said
I don't regret anything at all
I remember how we wept

On a bridge of violent people
I was small enough to cry
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

Hold my face before you
Still my trembling heart
Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

The gods forgot they made me
So I forget them too
I listen to the shadows
I play among their graves

My heart was never broken
My patience never tried
I got seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

Seven days to live my life
Or seven ways to die

We All Go Through,"- Album: Hours (Japanese edition only)
- CD single: Thursday's Child
- Lyrics David Bowie music by Bowie & Gabrels 

Skeletal city highs
Crazies with dumb replies
Nobody's eyes anymore

Frown on your beggar's face
Walking this lunarscape
Nothing in my lackaday

We'll all be right
We'll all be right
We'll all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes

Somebody's space to rent
Somebody's soul to dent
Dog is in every word

Hiding the flames of power
Hiding us home by home
Nearly got out yesterday

We'll all be right
We'll all be right
We'll all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes

Trouble it travels on the wing
Doorway to door
Open your eyes
Nothing remains
A secret love between us

Nothing can hide for long
We are the morning song
Holding my breath anyway

We'll all be right
We'll all be right
We'll all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes

We'll all be right
We'll all be right
We'll all be right in the now
We all go through
We all go through
We all go through it sometimes
Through it sometimes
(We all go through)
Through it sometime
(We all go through)

I'm a blind man and she's my eyes

Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd, it's always time
Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd, it's always time

We Shall Go to Town,"No more delight or croning around
Whisper the word hold my hand
Nowhere forget I shall refuse you
Never forget who you've been
And you will fight with demons
And we shall go to town
And we'll read between the riches
And we'll dream if we don't go down

Follow the paths stay on the wrong side
Only when you is swollen with tears
Don't bring your things just like you serve you
Only fool turns around
And you will fight with demons
And we shall go to town
And you will wear you're best shoes
And we'll dance if we don't go down
And we'll dance if we don't go down"

Survive,"Oh my, naked eyes
I should have kept you
I should have tried
I should have been a wiser kind of guy
I miss you

Give me wings
Give me space
Give me money for a change of face
Those noisy rooms and passion pants
I love you

Where's the morning in my life?
Where's the sense in staying right?
Who said 'time is on my side'?
I've got ears and eyes and nothing in my life
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

You alone across the floor
You and me and nothing more
You're the great mistake I never made
I never lied to you, I hated when you lied
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

Beatle boys, all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs, every night
Wish I'd sent a Valentine
I love You

I'll survive
Naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
My naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
Naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
I'll Survive"
Something in the Air,"Your coat and hat are gone
I really can't look at your little empty shelf
A ragged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Don't look me in the eye

We lay in each other's arms
But the room is just an empty space
I guess we've lived it out
Something in the air
We smiled too fast then can't think of a thing to say

Lived with the best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Nothing left to save
Let's take what we can
I know you'll hold your head up high
We've raged for the last time
A place of no return

And there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
Yea
Something in the air
Something in my eye

Abracadoo, I lose you
We can't avoid the clash, the big mistake
Now we're gonna pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Can't believe I'm asking you to go

We used what we could
To get the things we want
But we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I never wanted anyone more than you

Lived all our best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Say what you will
There's something in the air
Raged for the last time
But I know you'll hold your head up high
There's nothing we have to say
There's nothing in our eyes

But there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
There's something I have to say
There's something in the air
Something in my eye
Doo-doo-doo doo doo
Doo-doo-doo doo doo
I've danced with you too long
Doo-doo-doo doo doo
Doo-doo-doo doo doo
Danced with you too long
Doo doo
Danced with you too long
Something in the air
Something in the air
Doo-doo doo doo

If I'm Dreaming My Life,"Was she never there
Was she ever
Was it air she breathed
At the wrong time

All the flowers so
From the gallery
With the hymns of night
Singing come to me

On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life

Just one living chance
When the mother sighs
When the father steps aside
At the wrong time
Oh ho
Oh ho

Was she never here
Was she ever
Was it air she breathed
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now

The Dreamers,"Black eyed ravens
They spiral down
They tilt his head back
To the flame filled sunset
Raise their guns high
As the darken falls
These are the days boys

Shallow man
Shallow man (shallow man) and they
Eats in the doorways with his head inclined
And he's always in decline
No one hears anymore
So he shrinks as they ride
Under vermilion skies

So it goes (so it goes)
Just a searcher (so it goes)
Lonely soul (so it goes)
The last of the dreamers (so it goes)

Shallow man
Shallow man
Speaks to the shadows
Moves his trembling hands
And he's always a little late
For the dawning of the day

So it goes (so it goes)
Just a searcher (so it goes)
Lonely soul (so it goes)
The last of the dreamers (so it goes)

(So it goes) Just a searcher
(So it goes) Lonely soul

The Pretty Things Are Going to Hell,"What to wear, what to say

What is clay and what is sand?
Who to dis, who to trust
Who to listen to and who to suss?

A Better Future,"Please don't tear this world asunder

Or I might just stop needing you

Give my children sunny smiles
Give them warm and cloudless skies

We talk too
When you walk
We walk too

From factory to field
How many tears must fall
Down here below
Nothing is moving

Sunday,"Nothing remains

Look for the drifters

Look for the shafts of light on the road

And nothing has changed
Everything has changed
For in truth, it's the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed

I believe my little soul has grown

And I'm still so afraid
Yes, I'm still so afraid
Yeah, I'm still so afraid on my own
On my own

What made my life so wonderful?
What made me feel so bad?
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds

If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile
If I can talk on television
If I can walk an empty mile

Then I won't feel afraid
No, I won't feel afraid
I won't be, be afraid
Anymore
Anymore

And the street overflows
With the folk who understand
But for the brigader who can't be seen
He's the Shadow Man
And the Shadow Man is close at hand

Take a turn and see his smile
Made of nothing but loneliness
Just take a walk and be a friend
To the Shadow Man

You can call him John, you can call him Sam
You should call and see who answers
For he promises to come running, guided by the truth
But the Shadow Man is really you

Look in his eyes and see your reflection
Look to the stars and see his eyes
He'll show you tomorrow, he'll show you the sorrows
Of what you did today

You can call him foe, you can call him friend
You should call and see who answers
For he knows your eyes are drawn to the road ahead
And the Shadow Man is waiting round the bend
Oh, the Shadow Man
Ohooooo ooh
Shadow man, shadow man
It's really you, it's really you, it's really you
He's the shadow man
Oh yeah
Shadow man"

Wood Jackson,"Wood jackson
- CD single: Slow Burn
- CD single: Everyone Says 'Hi' (part 1)

Jackson made twenty tapes in a day
To give away
A give away

And he play
The tunes they'd call creative when they're running out of names
Heaven knows he's really torn it now
But the names it hurt poor jackson stopped the haters in his way
Heaven knows he's for it

Sha-a-a-me!
Hey hey
He was never quite unsure but really sane
Wants to play

Jackson stole twenty souls in a day
To take away
A take away
He takes away
And no complaints
Heart's upon his sleeve and his blade
Wood jackson took the beating every day, given out, passed away, another way
Hey hey
Just wants to play
And how he played
The mob they bleed and tremble when they're running after life
Heaven knows he's really torn it now
The words that killed Wood jackson's friends were written on the wall
Heaven knows he's for it

Shame!
Just wants to play
It's a shame
Shame
It's a shame
Wants to play
It's a shame
It's a shame
Just wants to play"
Slow Burn,"Here shall we live in this terrible town
Where the price for our eyes shall squeeze them tight like a fist
And the walls shall have eyes
And the doors shall have ears
But we'll dance in the dark
And they'll play with our lives

Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and round

But who are we
So small in times such as these
Slow Burn
Slow Burn

Oh, these are the days
These are the strangest of all
These are the nights
These are the darkest to fall

But who knows?
Echoes in tenement halls
Who knows?
Though the years snare them all

Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Twirling us round and round and upside down

There's fear overhead
There's fear overground
Slow Burn
Slow Burn

Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and round

And here are we
At the center of it all
Slow Burn
Slow Burn
Slow Burn"
Heathen (The Rays),"Steel on the skyline
Sky made of glass
Made for a real world
All things must pass

Waiting for something
Looking for someone

And when the sun is low
And the rays high
I can see it now
I can feel it die"
Slip Away,"Oogie waits for just another day
Drags his bones to see the Yankees play

Except for me and you
They slip away
They slip away

Don't forget to keep your head warm

Watching all the world in war torn
How I wonder where you are
Oh-ooh
Sailing over Coney Island

We were dumb but you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are

Some of us will always stay behind

When the Boys Come Marching Home,"How to make amends for the things they said
The girls avoid the stormy sky
But I and my cloudy face
Will be gone, high-tailing out of here
Is the lights a-blazing in their lonely town?
I love the little cars at dawn
But I and my heathen heart
Will be lain upon some foreign shore
Here's the saddest Joe on the corner of the town
""Listen to the words!"" he cries
I love him in his craziness, his tatters and his courage
He'll thumb his nose at the straight and true

When the boys come marching home
They'll fly his rags from the highest tree
When the boys come marching home
(When the boys come marching home)
(Home, marching home)

Aching for some innocence and peace of mind
While the moon pulls up its net of souls
The sun presses down on my brave new world
But, in truth, I don't feel brave at all
Leave it all behind me to the townies and the wags
The kids who never learned to smile
While I and the cobbled nag I ride
Stumble down another weary mile
Here's to those who cluster,
Walking through the wars
The girls who never close till dawn
They rag upon the feeble
And they swan around the stronger
But their eyes are fixed on the edge of town
When the boys come marching home
They'll slide from view - tiny, two by two

When the boys come marching home
(Home, marching home)
(Home, marching home)
When the boys come marching home
(When the boys come marching home)
Boys come marching home
(Home, marching home)
(Home, when the boys come marching home)

Should've took a picture, something I could keep
Buy a little frame, something cheap
For you

Everyone says ""Hi""

Said you sailed a big ship, said you sailed away
Didn't know the right thing to say
I'd love to get a letter, like to know what's what
Hope the weather's good and it's not too hot
For you

Everyone says ""Hi""
Everyone says ""Hi""
Everyone says don't stay in a sad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says ""Hi""

If the money is lousy
You can always come home
We can do all the old things (doo wap wap wha ooh)
We can do all the bad things (doo wap wap)

If the food gets you leery
You can always phone
We could do all the old things (doo wap wap wha ooh)
We could do it, we could do it, we could do it (doo wap wap ooh)

Don't stay in a bad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says ""Hi""
Everyone says ""Hi""

Everyone says ""Hi"" (everyone says ""Hi"")
And the girl next door (everyone says ""Hi"")
And the guy upstairs (everyone says ""Hi"")
Everyone says ""Hi"" (everyone says ""Hi"")
And your mum and dad (everyone says ""Hi"")
Everyone says ""Hi"" (everyone says ""Hi"")
And your big fat dog (everyone says ""Hi"")
Everyone says ""Hi"" (everyone says ""Hi"")"
I Would Be Your Slave,"Walking in the snowy street
Let me understand
Drifting down a silent path
Stumbling over land
Open up your heart to me
Show me who you are
And I would be your slave

Do you sleep in quietude
Do you walk in peace
Do you laugh out loud at me
No one else is free
Open up your heart to me
Show me all you are
And I would be your slave

I don't sit and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand

I bet you laugh out loud at me
A chance to strike me down
Give me peace of mind at last
Show me all you are
Open up your heart to me
I would be your slave

I don't sit and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand

I would give you all my love
Nothing else is free
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave"
Looking for Water,"- Album: Reality
- Lyrics and music by David Bowie 

Still the leaves are spinning 'round
Take my hand as we go down, and down, and down
Looking for water 
Well, our light's gone in a New York minute
Don't know about you, but my heart's not in it
(Looking, looking, looking)
I'm looking for water
I'm looking for water
(Looking, looking, looking)

I can't breathe the air, can't raise a fact
'Cause all we've got left is a beat in the night, and I'm
(Looking for water)
Looking for water
(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)

Take my hand as we go down, and down
Leave it all behind, nothing could be found
(I'm, looking for water)
I'm looking for water
(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)
(I, looking for water)
Looking everywhere
(Looking for water)
Looking here and there
(I'm looking for water)
I'm looking for water
(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)
I can't live in this cage, I can't eat this candy
The edge of the earth to the spin in my head
The look in your eyes and never means never
The dawn's early light, baby, dark is forever

(Looking, looking)
(Looking, looking)

(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)
I
(Looking for water)
(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)
I
(Looking for water)
(Looking for water)
(Looking, looking)
I
(Looking for water)
(Looking for watter)
Looking, looking)
I
(Looking for water)
(Looking for watter)
Looking, looking)

Reality,"- Album: Reality
- Lyrics and music by David Bowie 

Tragic youth was looking young and sexy
The tragic youth was wearing tattered black jeans
Bearing arms and flaunting all her mischief
The tragic youth was going down on me

And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear

I built a wall of sound to separate us
And hid among the junk of wretched highs
I sped from Planet X to Planet Alpha
Struggling for reality

Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Ha ha ha ha
Whoo hoo

Hey, now my sight is failing in this twilight
Da da da da da da da da da
Now my death is more than just a sad song
Da da da da da da da da da
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear
Woo hoo

I still don't remember how this happened
I still don't get the wherefores and the whys
I look for sense but I get next to nothing
Hey boy welcome to reality

Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo

I've been right and I've been wrong
Now I'm back where I started from
Never looked over reality's shoulder

Ha ha ha ha
Huh ha ha ha
Woo hoo

Huh ha ha
Wooh
Woo hoo
Wooh"
Fly,"The television's on 
And I'm walking through the yard 
The house is fast asleep 
And I'm crying in my car 
Dying for the weekend
The kids are alright 
But they don't smile much 
They sit up in their garage 
With their decks and their stuff 
Dying for the weekend
The boy's on a charge 
But his mother doesn't know 
He never got around 
Yet to telling her son 
It would only make her crazy
And I'll be fine 
I'm only sleeping in my head 
And I can fly 
I close my eyes and I can fly

The television's on 
And I'm walking through the yard 
The house is fast asleep 
And I'm crying in my car 
Dying for the weekend
The kids have got a gig 
In an all night rave 
They're lookin' pretty tough 
But I still want to say 
Do you really have to go?
Down in the back street 
A skinny kid cries 
Bad drive Saturday 
Another life flies 
Dying for the weekend
And I'll be fine 
I'm only sleeping in my head 
And I can fly 
I close my eyes and I can fly
And I can fly 
And fall toward the end
And I can fly
And I'll be fine 
I'm only sleeping in my head 
And I can fly 
I close my eyes and I can fly"
Never Get Old,"Better take care
I think I better go, better get a room
Better take care of me
Again and again
I think about this and I think about personal history

Better take care
I breath so deep when the movie gets real
When the star turns round
Again and again
Looks me in the eye, says he's got his mind on a countdown (3, 2, 1)

Forever
I'm screaming that I'm gonna be living on till the end of time
Forever
The sky splits open to a dull red skull
My head hangs low 'cause it's all over now

And there's never gonna be enough money
And there's never gonna be enough drugs
And I'm never ever gonna get old

There's never gonna be enough bullets
There's never gonna be enough sex
And I'm never ever gonna get old

So I'm never ever gonna get high
And I'm never ever gonna get low
And I'm never ever gonna get old

Better take care
The moon flows on to the edges of the world because of you
Again and again
And I'm awake in an age of light and living it because of you

Better take care
I'm looking to the future, solid as a rock
Because of you
Again and again
Wanna be here, then I wanna be there
Living just like you, living just like me

Forever
Putting on my gloves
And I bury my bones in the marshland

Forever
Think about my soul
But I don't need a thing
Just the ring of the bell in the pure clean air

And I'm running down the street of life
And I'm never gonna let you die
And I'm never ever gonna get old

And I'm never ever gonna get...
I'm never ever gonna get...

And I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get...
And I'm never ever gonna get...

I'm never ever gonna get old"
The Loneliest Guy,"- Album: Reality
- Lyrics and music by David Bowie

Streets turn from walls
Empty smell metal
Weeds between buildings
Pictures on my hard drive
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy 
Steam on the floor
Shots by the mirror's frame
Clouds green and old
No Sign No nothing Now
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy

All the pages that have turned
All the errors left unlearned, oh
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
In the world
Not me
Not me"
Fall Dog Bombs the Moon,"- Album: Reality
- Lyrics and music by David Bowie 

Hope little girl
Come blow me away
I don't care much
I'll win anyway
Just a dog

I'm God damn rich
An exploding man
When I talk in the night
There's oil on my hands
What a dog

Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Fall dog bombs the moon

Devil in a market place
Devil in your bleeding face
Fall dog bombs the moon
What a dog

There's always a moron
Someone to hate
A corporate tie
A wig and a date
Just a dog

These blackest of years
That have no sound
No shape, no depth
No underground
What a dog

Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Fall dog bombs the moon

A devil in a market place
A devil in your bleeding face
Fall dog bombs the moon
What a dog"
New Killer Star,"See the great white scar
Over Battery park
Then a flare glides over
But I won't look at that scar

Oh, my nuclear baby
Oh, my idiot trance
All my idiot questions
Let's face the music and dance

Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you

All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now

(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) A new killer star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) The stars in your eyes
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go

See my life in a comic
Like the way they did the bible
With the bubbles and action
The little details in color

First a horseback bomber
Just a small thin chance
Like seeing Jesus on dateline
Let's face the music and dance

Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you

All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees

(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) A new killer star
(I got a better way) Ready set go
(I got a better way) The stars in your eyes

(I got a better way) I discovered a star
(I got a better way) Ready set go

Days,"- Album: Reality
- Lyrics and music by David Bowie

Hold me tight
Keep me cool
Going mad
Don't know what to do

Do I need a friend?
Well I need one now

All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you

All I've done
I've done for me
All you gave
You gave for free
I gave nothing in return
And there's little left of me

All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you

With redeyed pain I'm knocking on your door again
My crazy brain in tangles pleading for your gentle voice
Those storms keep pounding through my faded heart
I'll play your sooth my sorry soul

All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days I owe you

All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days I owe you

All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days I owe you

All the days of my life"
Bring Me the Disco King,"You promised me the ending would be clear
You'd let me know when the time was now
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Stab me in the dark, let me disappear
Memories that flutter like bats out of Hell
Stab you from the city spires
Life wasn't worth the balance
Or the crumpled paper it was written on

Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible
Hot cash days that you trailed around
Cold cold nights under chrome and glass
Led me down a river of perfumed limbs
Sent me to the street with the good time girl

Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible
We could dance, dance, dance through the fire
Dance, dance, dance through the fire

Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the Disco King
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive
Feed me no lies
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the Disco King
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the head of the Disco King

Spin-offs with those who slept like corpses
Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs
Killing time in the 70's
Smelling of love through the moist wind
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Close me in the dark, let me disappear
Soon there'll be nothing left of me
Nothing left to release

Dance, dance, dance through the fire
Dance, dance, dance through the fire
Tell me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the Disco King
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
Dead or alive
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the Disco King
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the Disco King
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the Disco King
Bring me the Disco King, bring me the Disco King"

Calling sister midnight
Well, I'm an idiot for you
Calling sister midnight
I'm a breakage inside

You know, I had a dream last night
Mother was in my bed
And I made love to her

Father he gunned for me
Hunted me with his six gun
Calling sister midnight
What can I do about my dreams?

Listen to me, sister midnight
You've got me walking in rags
Listen to me, sister midnight
You put a beggar in my heart

Hey, where are you sister midnight?
Can you hear me call?
Can you hear me well?
Can you hear me at all?"

God Bless the Girl,"Jacqui loves her work and her work is love
For there is no other
She says ""God has given me a job.""
Jacqui loves her work
There is no other

Jacqui's aiming for the stars but landed on the clouds
There is no other
Sitting in her corner, too afraid to run away
Like a slave without chains

The wonder turns to danger, spring turns to winter
God bless the girl
But I will treasure, treasure every single moment
God bless the girl

Fire turns to water, light becomes darkness
God bless the girl
And I don't wanna hurt you, just wanna have some fun
God bless the girl

God bless the girl
Yeah, I don't wanna hurt you, just wanna have some fun
God bless the girl

You don't need another friend, you just need a reason
There is no other
Jacqui loves her work and her work is love
For there is no other

The wonder turns to danger, spring turns to winter

But I will always treasure, treasure every single moment

Fire turns to water and light becomes darkness

Love Is Lost,"It's the darkest hour, you're twenty two
The voice of youth, the hour of dread
The darkest hour and your voice is new
Love is lost, lost is love

Your country's new, your friends are new
Your house and even your eyes are new
Your maid is new and your accent too
But your fear is as old as the world

Say goodbye to the thrills of life
Where love was good, no love was bad
Wave goodbye to the life without pain
Say hello, you're a beautiful girl

Say hello to the lunatic men
Tell them your secrets, they're like the grave
Oh, what have you done?
Oh, what have you done?
Love is lost, lost is love

You know so much, it's making you cry
You refuse to talk but you think like mad
You've cut out your soul and the face of thought
Oh, what have you done? 
Oh, what have you done?

Oh, what have you done? 
Oh, what have you done?"
Heat,"When we saw
Mishima’s dog
Trapped between the rocks
Blocking the waterfall

The songs of dust
The world would end
The night was always falling
The peacock in the snow

And I tell myself
I don't know who I am
And I tell myself
I don't know who I am

My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison

I can only love you
By hating him more
That's not the truth
It's too big a word

He believed 
That love is theft
Love and whores
The theft of love

And I tell myself
I don't know who I am
And I tell myself
I don't know who I am

My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison

But I am a seer
I am a liar
I am a seer
But I am a liar

You Feel So Lonely You Could Die,"No one ever saw you 
Moving through the dark
Leaving slips of paper 
Somewhere in the park

Hidden from your friends
Stealing all they knew
Love is thrown in airless rooms
Then vile rewards for you

But I'm gonna tell
Yes, I've gotta tell
Gotta tell the things you've said
When you're talking in the dark
And I'm gonna tell the things you've done
When you're walking through the park

Some night on the thriller’s street
Will come a silent gun
You've got a dangerous heart
You stole their trust, their moon, their sun

There'll come assassin’s needle 
On a crowded train
I bet you'll feel so lonely 
You could die

Buildings crammed with people
Landscape filled with wrath
Grey concrete city
Rain has wet the street

I want to see you clearly 
Before you close the door
A room of bloody history
You made sure of that

I can see you as a corpse 
Hanging from a beam
I can read you like a book
I can feel you falling
I hear you moaning in your room
Oh, see if I care
Oh please, please make it soon

Walls have got you cornered
You've got the blues my friend
And people don't like you
But you will leave without a sound, without an end

Oblivion shall own you
Death alone shall love you
I hope you feel so lonely
You could die

(You feel so lonely )
You could die
You feel so lonely 
You could die"

Like a Rocket Man,"Little Wendy Cocaine stumbles up the hill to pain
Nothing stops the go-to girl, nothing takes the place of taking aim
Little Wendy's out there shaking hips and cuckoo eyes
Crazy drives that dizzy crowd
Moonlight strokes the highlights in her hair
She sells and moves and finds my hand
And pulls me down and close so I can hardly stand
As I lay like dead for her, I'm fed into my head I'm led, oh, I am Sam
I'm crawling from the window, crawling down the wall
I'm happy screaming, yes, I am
I'm jumping on her daisy chain
I'm speeding through the dancehall like a rocket man
Now I wish today that yesterday was just tomorrow and
I could squeeze her grabby hand
Knowing that I never paid her for a gram
She's a drunken doxy off her trolly
Sent before her time into this poxy world
She's not fit for anything but dealing it
While heaven sings, I have this girl
She's got me eating rice and beans
I have no shape nor color, I'm God's lonely man
I don't want to die but I don't want to live
I'm speeding like a rocket man

Like a rocket man
Like a rocket man
Like a rocket man"

The Next Day,"""Look into my eyes,"" he tells her.
""I'm gonna say goodbye,"" he says yeah
""Do not cry,"" she begs of him goodbye yeah
All that day she thinks of his love, yeah

They whip him through the streets and alleys there
The gormless and the baying crowd right there
They can't get enough of that doomsday song
They can't get enough of it all

Listen

""Listen to the whores,"" he tells her.
He fashions paper sculptures of them
Then drags them to the river‘s bank in the cart
Their soggy paper bodies wash ashore in the dark
And the priest stiff in hate now demanding fun begin
Of his women dressed as men for the pleasure of that priest

Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day

Ignoring the pain of their particular diseases
They chase him through the alleys, chase him down the steps
They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death
And drag him to the feet of the purple headed priest

First they give you everything that you want
Then they take back everything that you have
They live upon their feet and they die upon their knees
They can work with satan while they dress like the saints
They know God exists for the devil told them so
They scream my name aloud down into the well below

Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day

Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day

Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day

So She,"For the priceless man
Who suffers gloom so slow
Eyes were stolen for her
A sleeping sky
Takes the moon so slow
I would slide away

Further out to sea
Further out to sea
So she

Feeling like I’d never been
She saw me smile
Feeling like I’d never been

In love
Feeling like I’d never been
The only one and all alone
The only one and all alone"
Where Are We Now?,"Had to get the train
From Potsdamer Platz
You never knew that
That I could do that

Where are we now? Where are we now?
The moment you know, you know, you know

Twenty thousand people
Cross Bösebrücke
Fingers are crossed
Just in case
Walking the dead

Where are we now? Where are we now?
The moment you know, you know, you know

As long as there's sun
As long as there's sun
As long as there's rain
As long as there's rain
As long as there's fire
As long as there's fire
As long as there's me
As long as there's you"
How Does the Grass Grow?,"There’s a graveyard by the station
Where the girls wear nylon skirts and
Sandals from Hungary

The boys ride their Riga 1’s
Upon the little hill
Such sadness and grief
The trees die standing

That’s where we made our trysts
And struggled with our guns
Would you still love me
If the clocks could go backwards?

The girls would fill with blood and
The grass would be green again
Remember the dead
They were so great, some of them

Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya
How does the grass grow?
Blood, blood, blood

Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya
Where do the boys lie?
Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow?
Blood, blood, blood

But I lived a blind life
A white face in prison
But you made a life out of nothing
Now I ride my black horse

I miss you more
Than you’ll ever, ever know
Waiting with my red eyes
And my stone heart

Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya
How does the grass grow?
Blood, blood, blood

Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya
Where do the boys lie?
Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow?
Blood, blood, blood

I gaze in defeat
At the stars in the night
The light in my life burnt away
There will be no tomorrow
Then you sigh in your sleep
And meaning returns with the day

Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya
Where do the boys lie?
Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow?
Blood, blood, blood"
Boss of Me,"Tell me when you're sad
I wanna make it cool again
I know you're feeling bad
Tell me when you're cool again

Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me

We fly through the night
The tears on your lips
Life has your mind and soul
It spins on your hips

Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed

Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me

You look at me and you weep for the free blue sky
I look to the stars as they flicker and float in your eyes
And under these wings of steel
The small town dies

Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed

Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me

Who'd have ever thought of it
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small town girl like you
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me
Would be the boss of me"
Dirty Boys,"Something like Tobacco Road
Living on a lonely road
I will pull you out of there
We will go to Finchley Fair

I will buy you feather hat
I will steal a cricket bat
Smash some windows, make a noise
We will run with dirty boys

When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down and the dye is cast
When the dye is cast and you have no choice
We will run with dirty boys

We all go mad, we all want you
Me and the boys we all go through
You've got to learn to hold your tongue
This ain't the moon, this is burnin' sun

When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down and the dye is cast
When the dye is cast and you have no choice
We will run with dirty boys"
The Stars (Are Out Tonight),"Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

We live closer to the earth
Nearer to the heavens
The stars are never far away
Stars are out tonight

They watch us from behind their shades
Brigitte, Jack and Kate and Brad
From behind their tinted window stretch
Gleaming like blackened sunshine

Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

Waiting for the first move
Satyrs and their child wives
Waiting for the last move
Soaking up our primitive world

Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

Their jealousy's spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever

And they know just what we do
That we toss and turn at night
They're waiting to make their moves
For the stars are out tonight

Here they are upon the stairs
Sexless and unaroused
They are the stars, they're dying for you
But I hope they live forever

They burn you with their radiant smiles
And trap you with their beautiful eyes
They're broke and shamed or drunk or scared
But I hope they live forever

Their jealousy's spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever

And they know just what we do
That we toss and turn at night
They're waiting to make their moves on us
The stars are out tonight, yeah

The stars are out tonight
The stars are out tonight, yeah"
The Informer,"I took the job, I packed the bag
I ride the train to the pick-up point
I'll be telling myself
There was no other way
That you brought it on yourself
Now my heart's aflame
At the end of your life
It's the end of your life

I've got a pool of blood
On this bathroom floor
The mirror's broke
There's a crack in the door
There's a broken window
That I'll be crawling through
Then I've changed my life
And we won't have you
We won't have you
No, we won't have you

Good or evil
Saint or whore
Domestic or public
I don't recall
You were on the ledger
Your name was double crossed
You were the prime assignment
So help me Christ

I've got major questions
About the Lord above
About Satan below
About the way we love
About the rule at the top
And the people coming up
And I still don't know
What we were looking for
But it wasn't you
No, it wasn't you
No, it wasn't you

It wasn't you
No, it wasn't"
If You Can See Me,"Oh, oh, oh
If you can see me, I can see you

I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroads, so take this knife
And meet me across the river

Just chutes and ladders and this is the kiss
American Anna, fantastic Alsatian
From nowhere to nothing
And I go way back

Children swarm like thousands of bugs
Towards the lights the beacons above the hill
The stars to the West, the South, the North
And to the East

Now you could say I've got a gift of sorts
A fear of rear windows and swinging doors
A love of violence and dread of sighs

If you can see me, I can see you
If you can see me, I can see you

I have seen these bairns wave their fists at God
Swear to destroy the beasts, stamping the ground
In their excitement for tomorrow

I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroads, so take this knife
And meet me across the river

I will take your lands and all that lays beneath
The dust of cold flowers, prison of dark of ashes
I will slaughter your kind who descend from belief
I am the spirit of greed, a lord of theft
I'll burn all your books and the problems they make

If you can see me, I can see you
If you can see me"
Your Turn to Drive,"Your turn to drive
Thick as a line, out of your mind.
(You need the time)
You're sweet and you're tired, watching the line.
(Watching the line)
You're making my songs, you're making my heart.
(Your turn to drive)
It's all in the songs, it's all in your mind
(Your turn to drive)
Drive (turn tonight)
So (turn tonight)
You gotta (turn to...)
(You gotta turn tonight)
(Turn tonight)
(Turn tonight)

(Your turn to drive)
You're making my songs, you're making my heart.
(Your turn to drive)
Thick as a line, out of your mind.
(Your turn to drive)
Drive (turn tonight)
So (turn tonight)
You gotta (turn to...)
(You gotta turn tonight)
(Turn tonight)
(Turn tonight)"
Lazarus,"Look up here, I'm in heaven
I've got scars that can't be seen
I've got drama, can't be stolen
Everybody knows me now

Look up here, man, I'm in danger
I've got nothing left to lose
I'm so high it makes my brain whirl
Dropped my cell phone down below

Ain't that just like me

By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
There I used up all my money
I was looking for your ass

This way or no way
You know, I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Now ain't that just like me

Oh, I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Oh, I'll be free
Ain't that just like me"
Blackstar,"In the villa of Ormen
In the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle
In the centre of it all
In the centre of it all
Your eyes

On the day of execution
On the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile
At the centre of it all
At the centre of it all
Your eyes
Your eyes

In the villa of Ormen
In the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle
At the centre of it all
At the centre of it all
Your eyes
Your eyes

Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre, then stepped aside
Somebody else took his place and bravely cried
""I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar""

How many times does an angel fall
How many people lie instead of talking tall
He trod on sacred ground, he cried aloud into the crowd
""I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar, I'm not a gangster""

I can't answer why (I'm a blackstar)
Just go with me (I'm not a film star)
I'm-a take you home (I'm a blackstar)
Take your passport and shoes (I'm not a pop star)
And your sedatives, boo (I'm a blackstar)
You're a flash in the pan (I'm not a Marvel star)
I'm the Great I Am (I'm a blackstar)

I'm a blackstar, I'm way up on money, I've got game
I see right, so wide, so open-hearted pain
I want eagles in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes
I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar

Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre, then stepped aside
Somebody else took his place and bravely cried
""I'm a black star, I'm a star's star, I'm a blackstar""

I can't answer why (I'm not a gangstar)
But I can tell you how (I'm not a flam star)
We were born upside down (I'm a star's star)
Born the wrong way around (I'm not a white star, I'm a blackstar)

I'm not a gangster, I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar
I'm not a porn star, I'm not a wandering star
I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar

In the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle
At the centre of it all
Your eyes

On the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile
At the centre of it all
Your eyes
Your eyes"

When I Met You,"You took everything but nothing more Now the room is dark Feels like pain again You could feel my breath You opened my eyes For I could not see When I met you When I met you I could not speak You opened my mouth You opened my heart My spirit rose become the centre of my world The seeds of my life The streams of daybreak Now the wounds The peck of a blackened eye An eye for the crowd When I met you I could not speak When I met you met you My spirit rose My kind of truth could not exist When I met you Now it's all the same It's all the same The sun has gone It's all the same But when I met you When I met you When I met you When I met you 

When I met you [You were afraid] When I met you [She stole your heart] I was the walking dead [She tore you down] I was kicked in the head [She tore you down] It was such a time [When I met you] It was such a time [When I met you] I was crushed inside [When I met you] I was torn inside When I met you When I met you I was too insane Could not trust a thing I was off my head I was filled with truth It was not God's truth Before I met you"
I Cant Give Everything Away,"I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
With blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes

I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away

Seeing more and feeling less
Saying no but meaning yes
This is all I ever meant
That's the message that I sent

I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away

I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away

I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
With blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes

I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away

I can't give everything
I can't give everything away
I can't give everything away"
No Plan,"Here there's no music here
I'm lost in streams of sound
Here am I nowhere now?
No plan

Wherever I may go
Just where
Just there
I am

All of the things that are my life
My desires
My beliefs
My moods
Here is my place without a plan

Here
Second Avenue
Just out of view
Here
Is no traffic here?
No plan

All the things that are my life
My moods
My beliefs
My desires
Me alone
Nothing to regret
This is no place, but here I am
This is not quite yet"
Dollar Days,"Cash girls suffer me, I've got no enemies, I'm walking down
It's nothing to me
It's nothing to see
If I never see the English evergreens I'm running to
It's nothing to me
It's nothing to see

I'm dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
I'm trying to
We bitches tear our magazines
Those oligarchs with foaming mouths phone
Now and then
Don't believe for just one second I'm forgetting you
I'm trying to
I'm dying to

Dollar days, survival sex, honour stretching tails to necks
I'm falling down
It's nothing to me
It's nothing to see
If I never see the English evergreens I'm running to
It's nothing to me
It's nothing to see

I'm dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
I'm trying to
It's all gone wrong but on and on
The bitter nerve ends never end
I'm falling down
Don't believe for just one second I'm forgetting you
I'm trying to
I'm dying to

I'm trying to, I'm dying to
I'm trying to, I'm dying to
I'm trying to, I'm dying to
I'm trying to, I'm dying to"
